# Current

- **Amy Mayer**, Research Associate. Amy does everything. Currently focused on estimating white-tailed deer populations in Rhode Island via forward-looking infrared aerial surveys. 


- **Laken Ganoe**, PhD Candidate. Researching Fisher (*Pekania pennanti*) spatial and population ecology within Rhode Island, USA to inform management strategies. Project details can be found on Laken's [project page](https://www.lakenganoe.com/meet-ri-fishers.html).

- **John Crockett**, PhD Candidate. Researching the spatial occurence of river otter (*Lontra canadensis*), beaver (*Castor canadensis*), and muksrat (*Ondatra zibethicus*) within Rhode Islands's watershed. Outcomes will inform state harvest decisions and land-management strategies.


- **Nicole Defelice**, MS Candidate. Researching the use of olfactory scents as misinformation to reduce exposure of beach nesting shorebirds to predators. This reserach follows work done in [New Zealand](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe4164).

- **Le Tan Quy**, MS Candidate. Researching the spatial ecology of the Silver-backed chevrotain (*Tragulus versicolor*)
