- **Dr. Michael Peyton**, Postdoctoral Researcher. Research focused on evaluating study design tradeoffs focused on terrestrial indirect effects (predator --> prey--> mountain shrub communities). 

- **Jonathan Crossley**, MS Candidate. Research focused on identifying areas of avian abundance and richness overlap with renewable energy development in Colorado. 

- **Libby Mojica**, PhD Student. Co-advised with Dr. Liba Pejchar. Researching the spatial ecology of Ferruginous hawk. 

- **Le Tan Quy**, MS Candidate. Researching the spatial ecology of the Silver-backed chevrotain (*Tragulus versicolor*)

- **Dr. Edwige Bellier**, Postdoctoral Researcher. <br>
Developed hierarchical Bayesian stochastic population reconstruction models to learn about fisher and white-tailed deer population demography. Currently working on evaluating the robustness of spatially explicit encounter models to estimate the population size of New England Cottontails.

- **Amy Mayer**, Research Associate. <br>
Amy does everything.

- **John Crockett**, PhD. Graduated 2025. <br>
Researching the spatial occurence of river otter (*Lontra canadensis*), beaver (*Castor canadensis*), and muksrat (*Ondatra zibethicus*) within Rhode Islands's watershed. Outcomes will inform state harvest decisions and land-management strategies.

- **Nicole Defelice**, MS. Graduated 2024.<br>
 Researching the use of olfactory scents as misinformation to reduce exposure of beach nesting shorebirds to predators. 

- **Laken Ganoe**, PhD. Graduated 2024. <br>
Researching Fisher (*Pekania pennanti*) spatial and population ecology within Rhode Island, USA to inform management strategies. Project details can be found on Laken's [project page](https://www.lakenganoe.com/meet-ri-fishers.html).
