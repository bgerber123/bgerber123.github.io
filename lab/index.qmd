# Current

- **Dr. Edwige Bellier**, Postdoctoral Researcher. Developed hierarchical Bayesian stochastic population reconstruction models to learn about fisher and white-tailed deer population demography. Currently working on evaluating the robustness of spatially explicit encounter models to estimate the population size of New England Cottontails.

- **Amy Mayer**, Research Associate. Amy does everything. Currently focused on estimating white-tailed deer populations in Rhode Island via forward-looking infrared aerial surveys. 


- **John Crockett**, PhD Candidate. Researching the spatial occurence of river otter (*Lontra canadensis*), beaver (*Castor canadensis*), and muksrat (*Ondatra zibethicus*) within Rhode Islands's watershed. Outcomes will inform state harvest decisions and land-management strategies.


- **Le Tan Quy**, MS Candidate. Researching the spatial ecology of the Silver-backed chevrotain (*Tragulus versicolor*)
