## **Compare State Detections**

The total number of detections by state from 2017 are (not limited to shared survey sites b/w years)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
a=table(detections2017$detections,detections2017$STATE)
knitr::kable(a,
      format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:60%;'")
```

<br>
<br>

The number of detections by state from 2022 are (not limited to shared survey sites b/w years)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
b = table(detections2022$detections,detections2022$STATE)
knitr::kable(b,
      format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:60%;'")
```

<br>
<br>


The naive occupancy by state for 2017 is

```{r,echo=FALSE}
a2=a[2,]/apply(a,2,sum)
knitr::kable(a2, digits = 3,
      format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:60%;'")
```

<br>
<br>


The naive occupancy by state for 2022 is

```{r,echo=FALSE}
b2=b[2,]/apply(b,2,sum)
knitr::kable(b2,digits = 3,
      format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:60%;'")
```

<br>
<br>


## **Direct Comparisons b/w 2017 and 2022**

There are two ways we can make comparisons between the spatial occupancy results fitted to survey 1 (2017) and survey 2 (2022). First, we can compare occupancy predictions for the entire sampling frame that is shared b/w the two surveys, or we can compare only at the sites/cells that were surveyed in both surveys.

<br>
<br>


### **Sampling Frame Comparison**

Below I summed the latent state occupancy for all sites/cells within the shared sampling frame to derive a probability distribution of the total number of occupied sites (left plot) and the overall probability of occupancy (right plot) for each survey.

![](./plots/plot.2017.2022.same.sampling.frame.comparison.png)

The probability of a decrease in total occupancy (from shared sampling frame) is `r round(length(which(diff.sum.z<0))/length(diff.sum.z),digits=2)`.

The derived posterior probability distribution for the difference in number of occupied cells between 2022 and 2017 is shown below.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(density(diff.sum.z),lwd=3,col=1,xlab="Difference in Occupied Sites",main="Comparison of occupancy results b/w 2022 and 2017")
```

The posterior quantities for the difference in the number of cells is
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(quantile(diff.sum.z,probs=c(0.025,0.50,0.975)),
             format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:40%;'")
```

##### *State Comparison*

Next, we can compare the posterior distribution of the probability of occupancy between the two surveys by state.

![](./plots/plot.state.comparison.sampling.frame.2017.2022.png)

The posterior quantities of the probability of occupancy for each state are

```{r,echo=FALSE}
df.state = rbind(quantile(WY.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(MT.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(ID.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(WA.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975))
)

rownames(df.state)=c("WY","MT","ID","WA")

knitr::kable(df.state,
             format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:40%;'")
```

<br>
<br>


#### *Site Prediction Differences*

Here is the mean difference in probability of occupancy between sites in 2022 and 2017.

### **Surveyed Site Only Comparison**

```{r,echo=FALSE}
load("./outputs/compar.2017.2022.surveyed.site.RData")
```

Below I summed the latent state occupancy for all sites/cells within the shared sampling frame to derive a probability distribution of the total number of occupied sites (left plot) and the overall probability of occupancy (right plot) for each survey.

![](./plots/plot.2017.2022.same.sites.comparison.png)

The probability of a decrease in total occupancy (from shared sampling frame) is `r round(length(which(diff.sum.z<0))/length(diff.sum.z),digits=2)``.

The derived posterior probability distribution for the difference in number of occupied cells between 2022 and 2017 is shown below.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot(density(diff.sum.z,bw=1.2),lwd=3,col=1,xlab="Difference in number of sites",main="Comparison of occupancy results b/w 2022 and 2017")
```

<br>
<br>


The posterior quantities for the number of cells is

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(quantile(diff.sum.z,probs=c(0.025,0.50,0.975)),
             format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:40%;'")
```

<br>
<br>


#### *State Comparison*

Next, we can compare the posterior distribution of the probability of occupancy between the two surveys by state.

![](./plots/plot.state.comparison.sites.2017.2022.png)

The posterior quantities of the probability of occupancy for each state are

```{r,echo=FALSE}
df.state = rbind(quantile(WY.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(MT.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(ID.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975)),
      quantile(WA.plot$Occupied.Sites,probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975))
)

rownames(df.state)=c("WY","MT","ID","WA")

knitr::kable(df.state,
             format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:40%;'")
```
