## **Context**

The spatial occupancy model was refit to the 2022 wolverine survey data. This was done for two primary reasons:

1. There were some organizational changes needed to data input files to make proper comparisons from wolverine occupancy  model results from the 2017 and 2022 surveys. For details, see `Motivation for and changes to data`.

  - Additional surveyed cells in Washington; all non-detections
  - Added the Copeland_Inman habitat covariate on occupancy to make it similar to the model fit to the 2017 survey data.

3. Based on findings from refitting the spatial occupancy model to the 2017 survey data, this model needed to be refit.
    - Used restricted spatial regression (RSR) rather than ICAR
    - More generalized prior probability distribution on the spatial variance parameter.
    - Added an occupancy covariate to separate occurrence probability by mountain range; this allowed CO, UT, and OR to properly estimate an occupancy at / near zero (which makes sense since there were no detections).
    

## **2022 Survey**

### Summary Information

- The number of sampled cells: `r length(unique(visitData2022$GRID_ID))`
- The number of cells in the sampling frame: `r length(unique(habData2022$GRID_ID))`
- The total number of cells with wolverine detections: `r sum(as.integer(as.character(detections2022$detections)))`

## **Spatial Modeling (2025)**

The 2022 wolverine detection / non-detection data were fit using a Bayesian spatial occupancy model (Johnson et al. 2013) via the `stocc` R package.

The spatial process model was fit using restricted spatial regression (RSR) and a threshold of 20,000 m; this forces the spatial process to only affect neighboring cells.


Here is a plot of the occupancy partial intercepts for the different mountain ranges (Grouping1 variable) and slope coefficient for the Copeland_Inman habitat variable; they are all well converged. 

```{r, fig.height=12,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(5,2))
plot(fitted$gamma[,1],type='l',main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n North Cascades")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,1]),main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n North Cascades")

plot(fitted$gamma[,2],type='l',main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Northern Rockies")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,2]),main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Northern Rockies")

plot(fitted$gamma[,3],type='l',main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n South Cascades")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,3]),main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n South Cascades")

plot(fitted$gamma[,4],type='l',main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Southern Rockies")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,4]),main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Southern Rockies")

plot(fitted$gamma[,5],type='l',main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Uintas")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,5]),main="Occupancy Partial Intercept \n Uintas")

```


```{r, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(fitted$gamma[,6],type='l',main="Occupancy Coefficient")
plot(density(fitted$gamma[,6]),main="Occupancy Coefficient")
```

The median and 95% CI's of the occupancy slope coefficient for the Copeland_Inman habitat variables are

```{r,echo=FALSE}
quantile(fitted$gamma[,6],probs=c(0.025,0.5,0.975))
```

The probability this effect is positive is `r round(length(which(fitted$gamma[,6]>0))/length(fitted$gamma[,6]),digits=2)`


Here is a plot of the spatial variance parameter, well converged and at a realistic value.

```{r, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(fitted$tau[,1],type='l',main="Spatial Variance Parameter")
plot(density(fitted$tau[,1]),main="Spatial Variance Parameter")
```

This parameter leads to more realistic site-level deviations on the probit scale.

```{r, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
hist(fitted$occupancy.df$eta.est,main="eta values for each site")
```

Here is the detection probability parameter.

```{r, fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(fitted$beta,type='l',main="Detection Coefficient (Probit scale)")
plot(density(fitted$beta),type='l',main="Detection Coefficient (Probit scale)")
```


## **Prediction Plots**

### New Model Overall Occurence

#### *Fitted Model (2022 survey)*

![](../plots/plot.wolverine.2022.png)

In this model, we can see spatial variation in occurrence by neighboring cells. Notice there are hot spots of occurrence surroundings cells with detections and cold spots where there is a collection of non-detections. This is because the spatial variation is being more appropriately estimated. 

What we are seeing is the influence of the spatial process in the model. How far this spatial effect extends is really important. The model in the 2020 manuscript and this model **use a threshold of effect of 20 km**, such that at most one cell is influencing the four most immediate and nearest cells. If this was not previously discussed, it should be so now. <span style="color:red">Does 20 km seem reasonable given wolverine movements and the size of the cell?</span> Note that the diagonal cells from a center cell are not being influenced at this distance.

### State Occupancy

Here are the posterior distributions of the number of occupied sites by state (left plot) and the probability a cell is occupied by state (right plot).

#### **Model Results (2022)**

```{r,echo=FALSE}
results=data.frame(State=c("ID","MT","WA","WY","UT","CO","OR"),
                  Number.Cells = c(199,188,93,164,48,45,33),
                       Median.Occupied.cells = c(77,34,14,52,0,0,0)
                       )


knitr::kable(results,align=c("c","c","c"))
