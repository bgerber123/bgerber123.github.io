## **Inference**

To investigate spatial factors affecting wolverine occupancy, we will use non-spatial Bayesian single-season occupancy models (via the R package UBMS and Unmarked). These models are more straightforward to interpret as there is no trading off between the spatial covariates of interest and a generalized spatial neighborhood process (used in the spatial occupancy model); the spatial occupancy models is intended for prediction, rather than inference.

To consider the spatial variables that influence wolverines occurence, we should only consider areas that have wolverines (Montana, Washington, Wyoming, Idaho). The states that do not have wolverines (or detected wolverines; Colorado, Utah, Oregon) do not help us understand the spatial factors because there are no wolverines available to select a certain site and not another site. Therefore, this analysis is limited to the 4-state sampling frame.


## **Covariates** 

These variables were derived by Jake Ivan and confirmed to be accurate. 

- *propBurned2016_2021*: The mean proportion a cell was burned between 2016 and 2021. Increasing values are hypothesized to decrease occupancy; recent fires potentially decrease food/cover. 

- *propBurned2001_2015*: The mean proportion a cell was burned between 2001 and 2015. Increasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy; old fires potentially increase food/cover.

- *propBurned2001_2021*: The mean proportion a cell was burned between 2001 and 2021. Mixes recent and old fires. Probably do not use.

- *meanHumanMod_2021*: The mean measure of human modification from Dave Theolbald.

- *meanNDVI_2022*: The mean NDVI by cell over years X-X. 

- *propCopelandInman*: Predicted potential habitat from CoplelandInman model. Increasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy. Used to define the sampling frame. 

- *ClusterCount*: Predicted connectivity of cells (function in ArcGIS); ask Jake. Increasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy, probably up to some point. 

- *SDMayDepth2022*: Standard deviation of snow depth in May. Decreasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy (more consistency at low values).  

- *MeanMayDepth2022*: Mean snow depth in May. Increasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy, up to some point.

- *SDMaySWE2022*: Standard deviation of snow water equivalent in May. Decreasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy (more consistency at low values). 

- *MeanMaySWE2022*: Mean snow water equivalent in May. Increasing values are hypothesized to increase occupancy, up to some point.

### *Covariate Correlations*

![](../plots/corrplot.variables.2022.png){width=1000}

**Noted High Pairwise Correlations**

*Preferred covariates in bold:*

- propBurned2001_2021 and **propBurned2016_2021**

- propCopelandInman and **meanHumanMod_2021** ; medium correlation.

- propCopelandInman and **ClusterCount and snow measures**

- All snow measures are correlated. Use **MeanMayDepth2022**.


## **Models**

We considered three models. In each, the variables hypothesized to effect occupancy varied (see below; general summary of the model and model syntax) while detection probability was always hypothesized to be effected by whether a site had bait or lure.

We will compare models using the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd; lower is better; Vehtari et al. 2016). 



-  **Model 1:** Human Modification*Habitat Connectivity
      - meanHumanMod_2021*ClusterCount
  
-  **Model 2:** Environmental model (NDVI with quadratic, burn, and Snow with quadratic)
      - meanNDVI_2022 + I(meanNDVI_2022^2) + propBurned2016_2021 + propBurned2001_2015 + meanMayDepth_2022 + I(meanMayDepth_2022^2)

-  **Model 3:** Simple Environmental and Human Modification with Connectivity
      - meanHumanMod_2021 + ClusterCount + meanNDVI_2022 + propBurned2016_2021 + propBurned2001_2015 + meanMayDepth_2022


## **Results**

### *Model Comparison*

Model 3 was most supported, as measured by expected log-poinwise predicted density (elpd). However, there isn't that much difference among models, especically when considering the variation (se_diff).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Models to consider
  load("../outputs/fit.m2")
  load("../outputs/fit.m3")
  load("../outputs/fit.m4")

  mods <- ubms::fitList(Model1 = fit.m2,Mode2= fit.m3,
                        Model3 =fit.m4)
  knitr::kable(round(modSel(mods), 3),format = "html",table.attr = "style='width:50%;'",align = "c",digits=3)
```


### *MCMC Convergence*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12}
traceplot(fit.m4, pars=c("beta_state", "beta_det"))
```

All parameter from the most supported model have convereged. 


### *Goodness of fit*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
 # Goodness of fit - by zeros
   sim_y <- posterior_predict(fit.m4, "y", draws=1000)
#   
 # Rows are simulations and columns are sites by observations 
   prop1 <- apply(sim_y, 1, function(x) mean(x==1, na.rm=TRUE))
   actual_prop1 <- mean(getY(fit.m4) == 1, na.rm=TRUE)
#   
   #Compare
   hist(prop1, col='gray',main="Simulated Proportion of Detections \nfrom Supported Model")
   abline(v=actual_prop1, col='red', lwd=2)
  legend("topright",legend=c("Observed Prop. of Detections"),lwd=2, col=2)
```

No departure of model fit using this test statistic.

### *Model Summary*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fit.m4
```

### *Probability of Support*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sims=data.frame(fit.m4@stanfit@sim$samples)
#colnames(sims)
sims= sims[,1:9]
n.mcmc=nrow(sims)
prob.positive=data.frame(apply(sims,2,FUN=function(x){length(which(x>0))/n.mcmc}))
colnames(prob.positive)="Probability>0"
rownames(prob.positive) = c("Occ.Intercept","Occ.meanHumanMod_2012","Occ.ClusterCount","Occ.meanNDVI2022",
                         "Occ.PropBurned2016-2021","Occ.PropBurned2001-2015","Occ_MeanMayDepth",
                         "Det.Intercept","Det.SiteType")
knitr::kable(prob.positive,format = "html",table.attr = "style='width:25%;'",align = "c",digits=2)
```

<br>

A probability near 1 indicates a strong support for a positive effect. 

A probability near 0 indicates a strong support for a negative effect. 

Probabilities between 0.1 and 0.9 indicate mild or no statistical support.


### *Marginal Effect Plots*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12}
plot_effects(fit.m4, "state")
```

Note that the x-axes vary, based on the standardization of the variable. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
plot_effects(fit.m4, "det")
```

## **Summary**

- There is clear statistical support that increasing connectivity (`ClusterCount`) leads to increase wolverine occupancy. 

- There is clear statistical support that increasing `meanNDVI_2022` leads to decreasing wolverine occupancy. 

- There is clear statistical support that increasing old fires  (`PropBurned2001-2015`) leads to increasing wolverine occupancy. 

- There is clear statistical support that lure decreases the probability of detection at an occupied site relative to bait sites.
