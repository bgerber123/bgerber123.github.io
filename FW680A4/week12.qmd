## Week 12

### Day 1

#### [Today]{style="color:red;"}

##### Discuss Paper Assigned by Waverly Davis and Lisa Roerk

##### Discuss Northrup et al. 2022

#### [Assigned]{style="color:red;"}
 -   Readings for next class:
     - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/171sCFawqLIFo472D7Tfhitlrj-sbJ6zDnYtOlbI4ijM/edit?usp=sharing">A plain language review for modeling animal habitat-selection (draft) </a>

The assigned reading is a draft manuscript that I am looking for feedback. Please feel free to make comments directly on the google doc. I am looking for areas of confusion, areas of flow or introduction of concepts that may be out of order, and areas that we can cut/de-emphasize, and areas that need expanding. This manuscript is not so much a review, but a modern synthesis to give some important context/opinion and then point the reader to modern papers.
