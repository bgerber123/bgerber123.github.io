**Readings**: Come prepared to discuss the assigned reading on the next class after the readings were assigned. 

- What was interesting and useful? What did not make sense? What did you disagree with? What did you learn? <span style="color:red">Bring points to highlight and bring questions (make a list). Check each week's link to see if there are listed reading questions.</span>

**Labs**: are started in class on the day they are listed under and any relevant lab assignment is due one week later, unless otherwise stated.
