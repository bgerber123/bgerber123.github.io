**Readings**: Come prepared to discuss the assigned reading on the next class. What was interesting and useful? What did not make sense? What did you disagree with? What did you learn? <span style="color:red">Bring points to highlight and bring questions (make a list). Check each week's link to see if there are listed reading questions.</span>
