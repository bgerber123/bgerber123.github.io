### Co-lead Discussion

- Students will be grouped and assigned a topic (e.g., mark-recapture). 

- Each group should pick an application paper (ideally) or methods paper (if desired) that is published on the assigned topic for the class to read. 

- Please send the paper (pdf) to me via email **2 weeks** before the topic is listed on the <a href="schedule.qmd">Schedule</a>; I will then post the paper on the website under the class prior to the discussion date.

- The group should come prepared to lead the discussion on the paper for (20-25 minutes). Assign questions for us to focus on or come prepared with questions to lead the discussion. Generally focus on things like...

  - what is the statistical model
  - did the authors define it clearly or reference another paper
  - the type of data that is relevant
  - how the sampling was achieved
  - the inference/prediction that was sought
  - how the model was used to answer the fundamental research question
  - nuisances of issues of concern in the modeling or sampling
  - try and connect principles/stastistics in the paper to what we have been doing in the class


## Assigned Groups

**Species Distribution Model (10/8):** 		Libby Mojica, Travis Rainey		
**Mark Recapture (10/11):**		Alex Badeaux, Noel Clark, Elke Tukker		
**N mixture or Integrated Data Models (10/22):**	Sarah Gaulke, Sean Ingram		
**Animal Movement (10/25):**		Jeremy Alder, Becca Windell		
**Habitat Selection (11/1):**		Waverly Davis,  Lisa Roerk		
**Community Modeling (11/12):**		Cat Adams, Bijoya Paul		


### Project

-   Work individually or in a group of 2

-   Decide on whether you will work on a 1) research project or 2) develop a short lecture along with a lab-case study.
