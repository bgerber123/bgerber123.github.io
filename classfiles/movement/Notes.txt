Discuss basics of animal movement data-

Location data can be collected using surveys within a predetermined frame of reference (i.e., Eulerian sampling) or from animal-borne tracking devices (i.e., Lagrangian sampling). Integration of observations obtained from Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives can provide insights into animal movement and habitat use.

Tracks. Missing locations.
