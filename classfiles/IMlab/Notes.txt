The idea is to walk through the text in the book for the setup

Then walk through psi - lambda connection and code

We then fit each model separately.

Then together we create the script (model.fit.integrated.r) and jags model for the integrated model (IM.jags)

The Assignment is to ask the students to fit a model to detection non-detection data. Then incorporate that into a new integrated model
