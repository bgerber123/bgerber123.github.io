# Assigment

Write a report that presents code and results that evaluates the below hypotheses related to African Elephant weight. The data file is `elephant.study.csv`. There are three columns, where each row is an individual sampled elephant, indicating the variables of `weight` (weight in lbs), `age.years` (age of elephant in years), and  `lat` (mean latitude of the elephants home range).

#### Your report should ...

- explore/present the data. use plots/histograms
- write model notation correctly or use equatiomatic
- fit the model with lm or glm to get MLEs and CI's. Define Type I error rate
- interpret results, in relation to hypotheses. Make statements about 'statistical clarity' and support or not for the hypotheses
- make prediction plots
- evaluate model assumptions
- conclusions and caveats (think about what we have not considered)
- Appendix: present a summary of the R packages you used

Throughout, add text around your code and results to allow the reader to follow your thinking. The text should be minimal.


### Hypotheses/Predictions


![](elephant.png){width=1000}

I hypothesize that adult African Elephants (*Loxodonta africana*) increase in weight as they age because they are more efficient at conserving energy and acquiring high quality resources. As such, I predict that older elephants will weigh more than younger adult elephants. Further, I hypothesize that there is a latitudinal effect on the weight of elephants across the continent of Africa because of the extreme drought in the southern part of their range. I predict that elephants further north will weigh more than elephants further south. 

I evaluated these hypotheses by aggregating data on weights of elephants from collaborators. Each individual elephant was weighed in the same manner while being fit with a GPS collar. Each individual had a known age due to longterm demographic monitoring. I derived the mean latitude of each elephants dry season home range. 

### Explore Data

This data set consists of three columns. The response variable is `weight` and the two independent variables are `age.years` and `lat`.

```{r, data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=10}
  dat = read.csv("elephant.study.csv")
  head(dat)

  par(mfrow=c(3,1))
    hist(dat$weight)
    hist(dat$age.years)
    hist(dat$lat)
```

Looking at the data, we see a good frequency of weights ranging from  `r as.integer(min(dat$weight))` to `r as.integer(max(dat$weight))`. The independent variables are also well distributed and with relatively similar frequency. To make statements of statistical clarity when it comes to rejcting or no rejecting a null hypothesis of no difference, I use a Type I error ($\alpha = 0.05$).

### Define and Fit Model

To evaluate my hypotheses, I will consider a linear regression model with an additive effect of `age.years` and `lat`. I mean centered the variable `age.years` so that the intercept can be interpreted in relation to the average weight of elephants when at the equator (`lat = 0`).

```{r, model, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
model = lm(weight~I(age.years-mean(age.years))+lat, data=dat)
summary(model)
equatiomatic::extract_eq(model)
```

$$
\begin{align} 
\epsilon \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2) 
\end{align}
$$

```{r, equation, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
equatiomatic::extract_eq(model, use_coefs = TRUE)
```

**Better Model Notation:**

For each i$^{th}$ elephant, we define out model as,

$$
\begin{align*}
y_{i} \sim& \text{Normal}(\mu_{i}, \sigma)\\
\mu =& \beta_{0} + \beta_1 \times (\text{age}_{i}- \bar{\text{age}}) + \beta_2 \times \text{latitude}_{i}.
\end{align*}
$$

<br>

I found the average weight of elephants at the equator (`lat = 0`) was `r as.integer(summary(model)$coefficients[1,1])` lbs. The effect of age on weight was statistically unclear (p = `r round(summary(model)$coefficients[2,4],digits = 2)`), not supporting my hypothesis. The estimated effect was relatively small and negative $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ `r round(model$coefficients[2],digits=2)`, 95% CI = `r round(confint(model)[2,],digits=2)`. I found a statistically clear effect of latitude (p = `r round(summary(model)$coefficients[3,4],digits=4)`) with an estimated effect $\hat{\beta_{2}} =$ `r round(model$coefficients[3],digits=2)`, 95% CI = `r round(confint(model)[3,],digits=2)`. However, this does not support my hypothesis that elephants would weigh more the further north they lived. Instead, we see that weights decreas with increasing latitude. 


### Predictions


```{r, preds, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot_predictions(model, condition = list("age.years"))
plot_predictions(model, condition = list("lat"))
```

The marginal effect plots show the lack of evidence of the effect of age on weight and the support for decreasing weight with latitude. I suggest that this effect is biologically relevant, given that at the extremes in latitudes, we see that the mean weights of elephants is decreased by 18.125%. 


```{r, preds2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot_predictions(model, condition = list("age.years","lat"))
```

The joint prediction plot demonstrates the same findings and the assumption of the additive effect between independent variables. 

### Model Assumptions

```{r, assumptions, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggResidpanel)
resid_panel(model)
```

The top-right plot shows that the residuals are equally spaced below and above zero and that the variation within predicted values are relatively similar. The top-right plot shows no departre of the empirical quantiles of the residuals compared to theoretical values. Lastly, the bottom-right plot shows the residuals look symmetric and roughly Normally-distributed. 

```{r, assumptions2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(model,4); plot(model,5)
```

Looking at the leverage of each observation, there appears to be a few potential outliers (measured by Cook's distance), but overall there appears to be little concern. However, to evaluate the effect of the three most extreme values, I will drop these observations and then assess whether the interpretation of the results change. 

```{r, assumptions4, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
dat2=dat[-c(69,75,96),]

model2 = lm(weight~I(age.years-mean(age.years))+lat, data=dat2)
summary(model2)$coefficients
```

We see that the estimated coefficients change relatively little. My interpretation of the results are the same. 

### Conclusions and Caveats

I did not find support of either my hypotheses. Rather, I found evidence of a relevant biological effect where the mean weight of elephants decreased with increasing latitude. The total amount of the data that was explained by this model was relatively weak with an $R^2 =$ `r round(summary(model)$r.squared,digits=2)``.

There are several caveats we need to consider.

- Sex was not controlled for. Males and female elephants are known to have different mean weights
- The season of when an elephant was weighed is unknown and thus not controlled for
- I did not consider an interaction between age and latitude
- The range of ages might have limited our evaluation of the hypothesis. For example, 10 year olds may not be considered adults.
