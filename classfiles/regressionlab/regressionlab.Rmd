# Assigment

![](elephant.png){width=500}

Write a report that presents code and results that evaluates the below hypotheses related to African Elephant weight. The data file is `elephant.study.csv`. There are three columns, where each row is an individual sampled elephant, indicating the variables of `weight` (weight in lbs), `age.years` (age of elephant in years), and  `lat` (mean latitude of the elephants home range).

#### Your report should ...

- Explore/present the data. use plots/histograms
- Write model notation correctly or use equatiomatic
- Fit the model with lm or glm to get MLEs and CI's. Define Type I error rate
- Interpret results. Make statements about 'statistical clarity' and support or not for the hypotheses
- Make prediction plots
- Evaluate model assumptions
- Conclusions and caveats (think about what we have not considered)
- Appendix: present a summary of the R packages you used using `grateful`.

Throughout, add text around your code and results to allow the reader to follow your thinking. The text however should be minimal and to the point.


### Hypotheses/Predictions


I hypothesize that adult African Elephants (*Loxodonta africana*) increase in weight as they age because they are more efficient at conserving energy and acquiring high quality resources. As such, I predict that older elephants will weigh more than younger adult elephants. Further, I hypothesize that there is a latitudinal effect on the weight of elephants across the continent of Africa because of the extreme drought in the southern part of their range. I predict that elephants further north will weigh more than elephants further south. 

I evaluated these hypotheses by aggregating data on weights of elephants from collaborators. Each individual elephant was weighed in the same manner while being fit with a GPS collar. Each individual had a known age due to longterm demographic monitoring. I derived the mean latitude of each elephants dry season home range.
