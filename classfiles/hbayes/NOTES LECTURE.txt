The idea is to setup the basic GLM model as a Bayesian model on the board

Then write the JAGS model

Then ask the students to fit that model


Then we walk through the pdf 'Bayesian hierarchical model' and the JAGS models model.jags1.r and model.jags2.r. We then
fit these models together via script model.script.


Then we go back to the board to write the statistical model and code syntax

for the extra variance parameter per camera/site and the one for the extra variance for the PA.

I then ask the students to write out those models and fit these models
