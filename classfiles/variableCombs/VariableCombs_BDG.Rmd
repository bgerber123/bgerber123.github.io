# Questions

### 1. What model syntax allows for the effect of age.years to be different at each level of  site?

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
first = glm(weight~age.years+site+age.years:site)
second = glm(weight~age.years+site)
third = glm(weight~age.years*site)
fourth = glm(weight~poly(age.years,2)+site
```

<b><span style="color:purple">First and Third</span></b>

<br>

### 2. Draw an x-y plot showing the relationship b/w weight and the additive effect of site and age.years. Assume a negative slope of age.years with weight and two levels of the variable site. Assume the intercept mle is 13000 and the estimated effect of siteSite2 = -2000. Label axes and slopes for each site.

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
glm(weight~age.years+site)
```

<b><span style="color:purple"> The plot should have weight on the y-axis and age.years on the x-axis. There should be two lines, representing the slopes of age.years for each site. The slopes should be parallel with site 2 lower than site 1.
</span></b>

<br>

### 3. Looking at the data table above, write out the design matrix for the two models below.

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
glm(weight~age.years+site)
glm(weight~age.years*site)
```


```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
head(model.matrix(weight~age.years+site,data=dat))
head(model.matrix(weight~age.years*site,data=dat))
```


### 4. When might it be good to assume an additive effect b/w a categorical and continuous variable over an interaction? 

<b><span style="color:purple"> When there are many levels of the categorical variable and not a lot of replicate data at each or some levels. Also, when the hypothesis is an effect of difference by each level, but the same slope.
</span></b>

<br>

### 5. Define what each coefficient means. Make sure to make clear the units.

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
dat$age.yeras.sc = scale(dat$age.years,center=TRUE, scale=FALSE)
summary(glm(weight~age.yeras.sc*site,data=dat))
```

Intercept = the mean weight of elephants at the observed mean age of elephants at site 1

age.yeras.sc = the one year change in mean weight of elephants at site 1

siteSite 2 = the mean weight effect difference of site 2 from site 1 (intercept) at the mean observed age of elephants.

age.yeras.sc:siteSite 2 - the change in the slope or one year change in mean weight of elephants at site 2 from site 1
