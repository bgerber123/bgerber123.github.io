- Lecture: <a href="/FW552/random.response.qmd">Random Response Survey</a> 

#### **Assigned**

- 1. Evaluate how the sampling distribution of p-hat changes at different sample sizes. Do this for at least 3 sample sizes. Draw conclusions on how practical it is in your field for obtaining a sample size that would provide 'acceptable' results.

- 2. For a given fixed sample size (n=100), evaluate how the sampling distribution of p-hat changes, as measured by the standard deviation, when theta and p vary (seq(0.1,0.85,by=0.15)).
