*"era of big data"* - what does this mean for our field?

- $\sigma_Y$ is the population standard deviation
- $f = n/N$; sampling rate

"when $\rho(R,Y) >0$: larger values of Y are more likely to be in the sample than in the population and vice versa. Where $\rho(R,Y) =0$, this term cancels the others and there is no [systematic] error".

- Sampling Error is normal; big data or small data

. . .

- The issue: correlation b/w obtaining an observation and the value of the observation (*sample selection bias*)

. . .

- **Survey data**: correlation between *whether* a person responds and *what* their response is

. . .

- **Species distribution**: correlation between *where you sample* and the probability the species occurs there

## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Three ways to reduce 'errors'

$$
\begin{split}
\text{errors} &= \begin{array} \normalfont{\text{data}} \\ \text{quality} \end{array} \times \begin{array} \normalfont{\text{problem}} \\ \text{difficulty} \end{array} \times \begin{array} \normalfont{\text{data}} \\ \text{quantitiy} \end{array}
\end{split}
$$

. . .

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\mu} - \mu &= \rho_{R,G} \times \sigma_{G} \times \sqrt(\frac{N - n}{n})\\
\end{split}
$$

. . .

$\rho_{R,G}$ is the `data defect correlation` between the true population values (G) and what is recorded (R); measures both the
sign and degree of selection bias caused by the R-mechanism (such as non-response from voters from party X).



## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\mu} - \mu &= \rho_{R,G} \times \sigma_{G} \times \sqrt(\frac{N - n}{n})\\
\end{split}
$$

Often assumed that `Big data` reduces errors by the magnitude of the data quantity

. . .

<br>

BUT, the nature of big data is such that $\rho_{R,G} \neq 0$

- Major posit!

. . .

$\rho_{R,G} = 0$ under simple random sampling (SRS)!

## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Meng (2018) wanted to know the sample size (n) needed to achieve a certain level of error (mean squared error) with different levels of data quality:  

- $\rho_{R,G} = 0$ (SRS) and 
- $\rho_{R,G} = 0.005$ (Big Data))

. . .

- The example was voter survey data for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

- the correlation between *whether* a person responds and *what* their response was

## [Back to Boyd et al. 2023]{style="color:#078BCD;"}{.scrollable}


![](../img/MengEffectiveSampleSize.png)
- $f = n/N$

. . .

 - When $\rho_{R,G}$ deviates even slightly from 0, the relative effective sample size ($n_{eff}/n$) decreases with the true population size, N.(See Meng 2018; Figure 2) 

. . . 

**Implication:** When $N$ is large, your relative ESS ($n_{eff}/n$) is small; your data are worthless.

. . .

"In biodiversity monitoring, N is typically very large, so this reduction can be substantial."

<!-- x-axis is $f = n/N$ -->


## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Look at big data for what it is

- Meng's voter survey example 
  - n = 2,300,000 
  - $\rho_{R,G} = 0.005$
  - $N_{eff} = 400$ (assuming 100% response rate)
  - 0.99982608695 $%$ reduction in sample size


## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

We need to think about  **Mean Squared Error** ([Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error))

$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\mu}) = \frac{1}{n}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}\left(\hat{\mu}_{i}-\mu\right)^{2}
$$

. . .


$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\mu}) = E[(\hat{\mu}-\mu)]
$$

. . .


$$
\text{MSE}(\hat{\mu}) = \text{Var}(\hat{\mu})+(\text{Bias}(\hat{\mu},\mu))^{2}
$$



. . .

**Implication:** Same MSE can be achieved with different combinations of variance and bias$^2$.



## [Back to Boyd et al. 2023]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

![](../img/boyd.fig1.png)

- 'large biased' is $\rho_{R,G} = -0.058$, $n = 1000$
- MSE is the same
- **95% CI's include the truth 0% of the time for 'Large Biased'**


## [Back to Boyd et al. 2023]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Take home**: Large biased data --> highly biased and highly precise estimates

## [Meng (2018)]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

- "...what should be unbelievable is the magical power of probabilistic sampling, which we all have taken for granted for too long."

. . .

- "once we lose control over the $R$ mechanism, we can no longer keep the monster $N$ at bay, so to speak."

. . .

- "It is therefore essentially wishful thinking to rely on the “bigness” of Big Data to protect us from its questionable quality, especially for large populations."


## [Big Data Paradox]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Is there really a choice?**

1. Big Data with sample selection bias

2. Small sample from Simple random sample (no selection bias)
