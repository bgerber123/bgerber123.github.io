A colleague collected data at two sites (study 1 and study 2). They are interested in the mean number of beetles in each plot. A sample size of n = 10 plots were randomly sampled from a sampling frame of N = 100 at each site. The colleague was also able to use GIS data products to classify the ground cover (auxiliary information) at all plots/units in the population to which they sampled. They asked you to help them estimate the population mean abundance and variance of beetles for each site.
