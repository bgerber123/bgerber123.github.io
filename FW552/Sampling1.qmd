What is it called to use characteristics of sample to describe a 'population'?


## [Population and Sample]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Is it important to know what your target population is?

## [Population and Sample]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

<br>

Is your target population connected to your study objective?

## [Population and Sample]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

<b>Title</b>Muskrat occurrence in Rhode Island shows little evidence of land use change driving declines

**Clear target population and connected to study objective**

## [Population and Sample]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

<b>Title</b>Changes in species composition and community structure during plantâ€“pollinator community assembly

- The study sites (N=32) were located in the Central Valley of California 
- agricultural landscape composed primarily of conventionally managed monoculture crop fields
- three different experimental treatments: 
    - hedgerows with native species recently planted
    - mature hedgerows with native species planted 10 years
    - unrestored hedgerows (no restoration intervention).

## [Design- vs Model-based Infernce]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

What are important differences according to Thompson and Hankin et al.?

Benefits or costs of either?

. . .

**Important Considerations**

- randomness
- fixed
- undefinable infinite superpoulation vs. real target population

## [Design vs. Sampling]{style="color:#078BCD;"}


-   **Experimental Design:**
    - Deliberately perturbing a part of a 'population' to compare it's effect to a part that was not perturbed

-   **Sampling Design**: 
    - The process of obtaining a representative sample to characterize a 'population' w/o necessarily perturbing it.



## [Sample Language]{style="color:#078BCD;"}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

A sample (height in inches):

$\textbf{y} = [69, 54, 72, 61, 58, 71]$

<br>

A sample unit:

$y_{2} =54$ 

<br>

Sample size:

$n = 6$

## [Common Sample Units]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

. . .

- plots/quadrats - small geographic area to measure/count plants, seeds, insects, etc.
- points - measurements are taken from a set of points established thourghout a population
- transects - straight-line segments 
- individual organisms - the ornganism is the sample unit or the organism defines the location of the sample unit

## [More Language]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**What is a statistic?**

. . .

- An estimate of a population parameter from a sample

. . .

$$\hat{\mu} = \left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\right)\times \frac{1}{n}\right) = 4.1$$

- $n$ is a sample parameter (size of sample) 
- $\hat{\mu}$ is an estimate of a population parameter ($\mu$) from the estimator (mathematical rule for calculation) 
- 4.1 is a statistic (specific value)



## [More Language]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

$$\mu =\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\right)\times \frac{1}{N} = 4$$

- $\mu$ is a population parameter (measure of central tendency)
- $N$ is a population parameter (size of all possible sample units) 
- $4$ is the value of the population parameter


## [Sampling Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

- **Sampling Error**
    - The difference b/w a sample statistic (specific value) and the true value of a population paramter
    - 4.1 - 4 = 0.1 sampling error
    - Due solely to incomplete enumeration of the population (chance)
    - Protection against this is large sample size

## [Sampling Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

-  **Sampling Bias**
    - Systematic tendency of selecting certain sample units; makes the samples *unrepresentative* to the target population
    - Examples in fish/wildlife??
  
  
## [Sampling Variation and Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Target Population:** Weight of all black bears in a region

![](../img/bear.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

. . .

How would you describe a *sampling frame* relevant to this target population?

## [Sampling Variation and Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Create 'truth'
  set.seed(3433)
  pop.weights = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 300, sd = 100)

#Population mean
  pop.mu.weights = mean(pop.weights)

#Population standard deviation
  pop.sd.weights = sd(pop.weights)
  
# Sample Size  
  N = length(pop.weights)

# histogram    
  hist(pop.weights, main = "Total Population (N = 500)",freq=TRUE,xlim=c(0,700),xlab="Bear Weight")  
```

## [Sampling Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Vector of bear weights

```{r,echo=TRUE}
  pop.weights[1:5]
```

. . .

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Sample Size
  n = 50

# Sample and estimate mean one time
  sample.1 = mean(
                  sample(pop.weights,
                         n,
                         replace = FALSE
                         )
                  )

# Calculate Sampling Error
  sample.1 - pop.mu.weights
```

## [Sampling Variation vs Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Sampling variation is the process and sampling error is an outcome.

The differences between samples (sampling variation) lead to differences between sample statistics and population parameters (sampling error). 


## [Sampling Variation]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Calculate many many sample means

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Create function to sample 50 units and take the mean
sample.mean.fn = function(target,n){
                                    mean(
                                         sample(target,n)
                                         )
                                   }
#Repeat the above function 20000 times
  set.seed(54343)
  mu.hat=replicate(20000,
                   sample.mean.fn(pop.weights,n)
                   )

```

## [Sampling Variation]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mu.hat,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Distribution \n of Sample Mean for n = 50",xlim=c(240,380))
abline(v=pop.mu.weights,lwd=3,col=2)
legend("topright",legend=c("Population Mean"),lwd=2,col=2,cex=0.8)
hist(mu.hat-pop.mu.weights,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Error for n = 50")
```

## [Sampling Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

We should be very interested in the characteristics of the sampling distribution and error.

<br>

. . .

Expected Bias = average sample mean - population mean

## [Sampling Variation]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

We can summarize the sampling variation into a probability 

<br>

. . .

For n = 50, how likely is it that I'll be within 10% of the true population parameter?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
lower=pop.mu.weights - pop.mu.weights*0.10
upper=pop.mu.weights + pop.mu.weights*0.10

length(which(mu.hat>lower & mu.hat<upper)) / length(mu.hat)

```

## [Sampling Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Sample Population:** Weight of harvested black bears in a region that allows food provisioning

![](../img/beardonut.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## [Sampling Error and Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  sample.pop.weights = pop.weights[which(pop.weights>300)]

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  hist(pop.weights, main = "Total Population (N = 500)",freq=TRUE,xlim=c(0,500),xlab="Bear Weight")
  hist(sample.pop.weights, main = "Sample Population",col=2,freq=TRUE,xlim=c(0,500),xlab="Bear Weight")
```

## [Sampling Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

We only sample harvested bears with food supplementation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Repeat the above function 20000 times
set.seed(54343)
mu.hat=replicate(20000,sample.mean.fn(sample.pop.weights,n))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mu.hat,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Distribution \n of Sample Mean for n = 50",
     xlim=c(200,400))
abline(v=pop.mu.weights,lwd=3,col=2)
legend("topleft",legend=c("Population Mean"),lwd=2,col=2)
hist(mu.hat-pop.mu.weights,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Bias for n = 50")
```

. . .

Expected Bias =  `r round(mean(mu.hat)- pop.mu.weights,digits=2)`

## [Sampling Bias]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Relative Expected Bias = $\frac{E(\hat{\mu})-\mu}{\mu}$

Relative Expected Bias = `r round((mean(mu.hat)- pop.mu.weights)/pop.mu.weights,digits=2)`

## [Biased Estimator]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

We sample all bears but use a different estimator for the population mean

$$
\hat{\mu} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(y_{i})^{0.91}}{1.3}\right)\times \frac{1}{n^{1/2}} 
$$

## [Biased Estimator]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Repeat the above function 20000 times
biased.sample.mean.fn = function(x,n){
                                  temp=sample(x,n)
                                  sum(temp^0.91/1.3)/length(temp)^(1/2)
}
set.seed(54343)
mu.hat=replicate(20000,biased.sample.mean.fn(pop.mu.weights,n))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(mu.hat,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Distribution \n of Sample Mean for n = 50",
     xlim=c(0,2000))
abline(v=pop.mu.weights,lwd=3,col=2)
legend("topright",legend=c("Population Mean"),lwd=2,col=2)
hist(mu.hat-pop.mu.weights,breaks=40,main = "Sampling Error for n = 50")
```

Expected Bias =  `r round(mean(mu.hat)- pop.mu.weights,digits=2)`
