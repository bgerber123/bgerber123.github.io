- how to improve a current project
- designing a future study
- evaluating  sampling options in terms of bias/precision/cost/etc.  



<!-- ## [Course Learning Objectives]{style="color:#078BCD;"} -->

<!-- <!-- Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to: --> 

<!-- <!-- ::: incremental  --> 

<!-- - Identify different types of sampling designs and understand when to apply them -->

<!-- - Understand statistical estimators and their properties -->

<!-- - Frame a fish and wildlife sampling design problem and apply appropriate statistical tools to estimate parameters of interest in accordance with the selected design.   -->

<!-- - Be able to use fundamental code practices in the R programming language.   -->

<!-- ::: -->


## [Why is this class useful?]{style="color:#078BCD;"} {.scrollable}

-   Thinking from a sampling perspective is a super power!

-   Fundamental to scientific learning

-   Efficient learning about the world

-   Don't need any damn statistical model!

-   Interpret and frame learning from any "study"

## [Software]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

![](/img/logosR.png)


## [Why learn to code?]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

::: fragment
-   efficiency
-   transparency
-   flexibility in application
-   shareable
-   marketable skill
-   needed for publications
:::


## [Why use R?]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

::: fragment
-   open-source and free
-   small total user base / large in ecology and statistics
-   find help online, e.g., [stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/)
-   data management
-   statistics
-   plotting / graphics
:::

## [Why use RStudio?]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

-   Makes using R easier

<!-- ## [Coding in the Modern Age]{style="color:#078BCD;"} -->

<!-- - Software changes all the time -->

<!-- - Code will become obsolete   -->

<!-- - Base R functions change slower than packages -->

<!-- - Document/Annotate code and publish it online -->

<!-- - File management is important! -->

<!-- ## [File management]{style="color:#078BCD;"} -->

<!-- **Project Folder** -->

<!-- *Subfolders:* -->

## [Teaching Philosophy]{style="color:#078BCD"}

-   Learning is a choice (in every moment)

-   Words Matter

-   An inclusive environment is paramount for learning

-   Communication is everything

-   Everyone has something to teach and something to learn

-   Struggle is good. Solving problems leads to learning. But....

## [Questions]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

![](/img/question.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

## [A 'Sample']{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Brook trout habitat in rivers of Massachusetts**

<!-- ![](../img/prairie.png){width="600"} -->
![](../img/streamsMA.png){width="1000"}


. . .

A finite part of a *target population* whose properties are studied to gain information about the whole (i.e., to infer or gain inference).

## [A 'Sample']{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Brook trout habitat in rivers of Massachusetts**


![](../img/streamsMA.png){width="800"}


A selection of rivers (*sample*) to measure habitat characteristics (e.g. gravel beds) to be used to infer about habitat in all of the state.



## [Not Sampling]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Piping plovers nesting at Watch Hill, RI**

![](../img/watchhill.png){width="500"}

. . .

**Census:** a complete enumeration of a target population

## [Sampling]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

The process of selecting a representative part of the population for the purpose of determining characteristics of the target population.

. . .

**Why do we need to sample?**

. . .

- logistically/physically prohibitive
- fiscally prohibitive / waste of time and money
- timeliness
- sampling may be destructive


## [Central paradox of sampling]{style="color:#078BCD"}

- Impossible to know whether a sample is 'good' (i.e., representative of the target)

- The sample itself cannot tell us - only the process

- Given exact same sample, we treat it differently depending on how it was selected.

- A sample from a *reliable process* has credentials
