#### What do we use surveys for in our field?

![](../img/surveys.img.png)
## [Non-Sampling Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

- Differences b/w estimate and true population quantities that [do not]{style="color:red;"} arise because you didn't observe the whole population

## [Non-Sampling Error]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

#### Examples??

- Sensitive topics
- detection errors

## [Dealing with non-response]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

- Prevent it through the design (best solution!)
- Ignore it (common and may lead to bias)
- Take representative subsample of non-respondents
- Use a model / make assumptions 


## [Random Response Survey]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

#### How can we deal with non-response and "wrong" responses?

## [Random Response Survey]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

**Combine probability math and a survey technique to ask your question indirectly**

. . .

- First: you need a mechanism to receive an answer w/o knowing which question is being asked
- Second: you need to know the probability of the question
- Third: record the answers, frequency of yes and no's

## [Random Response Survey]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

::: {.incremental}

- Start with identical note cards with a fraction ($\theta$; this has to be known) marked
with $A$ and the remaining $(1- \theta)$ marked with $B$.

- If $A$, answer the question, e.g.,
    - have you ever cheated on an exam

- If $B$, answer the question, e.g.,  
    - have you never cheated on an exam

- A sample of people are chosen; each is asked to randomly draw a card and state ‘yes’ if they agree with the letter on the card or ‘no’ otherwise. 

- The interviewer does not ever see the card – just records ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

## [Random Response Estimator]{style="color:#078BCD;"}


$$
\frac{n_{\text{yes}}}{n_{\text{total}}} = \theta p+(1-\theta)\times(1-p)

$$
\hat{p} = \frac{1}{2\theta-1} \frac{n_{\text{yes}}}{n_{\text{total}}}-\frac{1-\theta}{2\theta-1}\text{where }\theta\ne0.5

\hat{\sigma}^2_p = \frac{1}{n_{\text{total}}}\left( \frac{1}{16(\theta-0.5)^2}- (p-0.5)^2\right)

## [Lots of variations]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

- flip a coin to pick the question
- Q1) primary, Q2) whether your phone number ends with an odd number

## [Test it?]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

#### What's our question?


## [Evaluate the Estimator]{style="color:#078BCD;"}

Let's consider how the sample size ($n$) effects the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$

Also, consider how our choice of $\theta$ effect the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$
