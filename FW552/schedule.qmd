**Book**: We will be using quite a bit of [Thompson. 2012. Sampling. Third Edition](/readings552/Sampling - 2012 - Thompson.pdf).

**Readings**: Come prepared to discuss the assigned reading on the next class after the readings were assigned. 

- What was interesting and useful? What did not make sense? What did you disagree with? What did you learn? <span style="color:red">Bring points to highlight and bring questions (make a list). Check each week's link to see if there are listed reading questions.</span>

**Assignments**: are assigned on the day they are listed; check Canvas for due date.
