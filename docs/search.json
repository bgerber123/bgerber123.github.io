    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe common view of emotional expressions is that certain configurations of facial-muscle movements reliably reveal certain categories of emotion. The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants’ self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPhysical attractiveness plays a central role in psychosocial experiences. One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n=181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA."

    "text": "Abstract\nAnthropogenic developments alter the environment and resources available to wildlife communities. In response to these real or perceived threats from this development, species may adjust their spatial occurrence. Additionally, wildlife species may adjust when in diel time (24-h light–dark cycle) they occupy sites on the landscape to adapt to changing conditions. However, many wildlife studies only focus on where a species does and does not occur, ignoring how species may shift their diel activity at sites to mitigate threats. We used a multi-state diel occupancy modeling framework to investigate how a community of mammals (mesocarnivores, urban-adapted omnivores, and herbivore/small mammals) respond to differing levels of anthropogenic development and forest cover across two climatic seasons. We collected camera trap data at 240 survey locations across the summer and winter of 2021–2022. We modeled multi-state diel occupancy for 14 mammal species with extent of development/forest and season hypothesized to influence diel occupancy and season hypothesized to influence the probability of detection. We found that all species displayed heterogeneity in both diel occupancy and detection either by extent of development/forest and or season. Within the mesocarnivore species group, coyote and red fox were less sensitive to development and had higher occupancy probability at these sites in general but used them more during the night, while more sensitive mesocarnivores including fisher and bobcat occupied the day state only when there was increasing forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating diel activity in habitat modeling to better understand the relationship between a species and its landscape, particularly in a region that is vulnerable to increased anthropogenic pressure."

    "text": "Abstract\nAnthropogenic developments alter the environment and resources available to wildlife communities. In response to these real or perceived threats from this development, species may adjust their spatial occurrence. Additionally, wildlife species may adjust when in diel time (24-h light–dark cycle) they occupy sites on the landscape to adapt to changing conditions. However, many wildlife studies only focus on where a species does and does not occur, ignoring how species may shift their diel activity at sites to mitigate threats. We used a multi-state diel occupancy modeling framework to investigate how a community of mammals (mesocarnivores, urban-adapted omnivores, and herbivore/small mammals) respond to differing levels of anthropogenic development and forest cover across two climatic seasons. We collected camera trap data at 240 survey locations across the summer and winter of 2021–2022. We modeled multi-state diel occupancy for 14 mammal species with extent of development/forest and season hypothesized to influence diel occupancy and season hypothesized to influence the probability of detection. We found that all species displayed heterogeneity in both diel occupancy and detection either by extent of development/forest and or season. Within the mesocarnivore species group, coyote and red fox were less sensitive to development and had higher occupancy probability at these sites in general but used them more during the night, while more sensitive mesocarnivores including fisher and bobcat occupied the day state only when there was increasing forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating diel activity in habitat modeling to better understand the relationship between a species and its landscape, particularly in a region that is vulnerable to increased anthropogenic pressure."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Expert consensus guidelines recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), interventions that were historically delivered face-to-face, as first-line treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite the ubiquity of telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about differential outcomes with CBT versus IPT delivered in-person (IP) or via telehealth (TH) or whether working alliance is affected.\nMethods: Adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for MDD were randomly assigned to either 8 sessions of IPT or CBT (group). Mid-trial, COVID-19 forced a change of therapy delivery from IP to TH (study phase). We compared changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) and Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) scores for individuals by group and phase: CBT-IP (n = 24), CBT-TH (n = 11), IPT-IP (n = 25) and IPT-TH (n = 17).\nResults: HRSD-17 scores declined significantly from pre to post treatment (pre: M = 17.7, SD = 4.4 vs. post: M = 11.7, SD = 5.9; p &lt; .001; d = 1.45) without significant group or phase effects. WAI scores did not differ by group or phase. Number of completed therapy sessions was greater for TH (M = 7.8, SD = 1.2) relative to IP (M = 7.2, SD = 1.6) (Mann-Whitney U = 387.50, z = 2.24, p = .025).\nLimitations: Participants were not randomly assigned to IP versus TH. Sample size is small.\nConclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of both brief IPT and CBT, delivered by either TH or IP, for depression. It showed that working alliance is preserved in TH, and delivery via TH may improve therapy adherence. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively test efficacy of brief IPT and CBT delivered via TH versus IP."

    "text": "Abstract\nSpruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) have impacted millions of acres of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) – subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest in North America over the past decade, resulting in the most extensive outbreak in recorded history. This dramatic alteration of forest composition and structure has precipitated numerous changes to forest ecology and ecosystem services. Among the least studied of these changes are impacts to wild mammals, including snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We sampled a chronosequence of spruce-fir stands along a gradient of ‘years elapsed since spruce beetle outbreak’ (YSO) in order to estimate impacts to abundance of these two species in the southern Rocky Mountains. Snowshoe hare abundance was not related to YSO, at least in the first decade post-outbreak. Instead, hare abundance during this period was positively related to horizontal cover, especially that due to stem density of small diameter subalpine fir. Notably, snowshoe hare abundance was negatively related to stem density of small diameter Engelmann spruce, suggesting that elements of horizontal cover may not be uniformly beneficial to hares. Hare abundance was also negatively related to ground cover, which could help explain the lack of relationship to YSO, assuming reduction in overstory canopy would lead to increases in ground cover. Red squirrel abundance was negatively related to YSO and outbreak severity (i.e., basal area of large diameter dead trees). This was likely due to diminished cone crops in impacted areas, which red squirrels cache and rely on heavily to sustain them through the winter. Basal area of remaining large live fir trees was not related to squirrel abundance, suggesting that regeneration of spruce and associated cone crops may be necessary for recovery of red squirrels, which may take several decades."

    "text": "Abstract\nTropical forests are the most species-rich biomes in the world but suffer high rates of logging and conversion. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals reliant on old-growth forest structures are especially vulnerable. The degree of behavioral arboreality of semi-arboreal mammals can be related to forest structure and perceived terrestrial threats. Paired arboreal and terrestrial camera traps are a promising new method for estimating the arboreality of cryptic and nocturnal species. Our study aimed to (1) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on the detection and occurrence of arboreal and semi-arboreal mesomammals and (2) evaluate differences in occurrence and detection between paired arboreal and terrestrial camera trap sites for semi-arboreal mammals while estimating the degree of arboreality. We set 20 terrestrial and arboreal camera trap pairs in eastern Cat Tien National Park (Nam Cat Tien), Vietnam, from June 2019 to September 2020. We evaluated the effects of forest structure and proximity to roads on nine arboreal mesomammal species using single-season occupancy models. We used multi-scale occupancy modeling to estimate the degree of arboreality for four semi-arboreal mammals. All models were fit using hierarchical Bayesian modeling and compared using WAIC. We detected most arboreal and terrestrial mesomammal species currently known to inhabit Nam Cat Tien, including rare and cryptic species. Canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important for explaining the detection and occurrence of highly arboreal species, while the effect of a tree and focal limb characteristics on detection was species-specific. All semi-arboreal species had a greater probability of terrestrial station use than arboreal, suggesting a greater vulnerability to terrestrial threats, though the degree of arboreality varied by species. Using one sampling method underestimated occupancy for most semi-arboreal species. Multi-method sampling designs with multi-scale occupancy modeling can improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use for guiding management and conservation decisions."

    "text": "Abstract\nManaging wildlife populations in the face of global change requires regular data on the abundance and distribution of wild animals, but acquiring these over appropriate spatial scales in a sustainable way has proven challenging. Here we present the data from Snapshot USA 2020, a second annual national mammal survey of the USA. This project involved 152 scientists setting camera traps in a standardized protocol at 1485 locations across 103 arrays in 43 states for a total of 52,710 trap-nights of survey effort. Most (58) of these arrays were also sampled during the same months (September and October) in 2019, providing a direct comparison of animal populations in 2 years that includes data from both during and before the COVID-19 pandemic. All data were managed by the eMammal system, with all species identifications checked by at least two reviewers. In total, we recorded 117,415 detections of 78 species of wild mammals, 9236 detections of at least 43 species of birds, 15,851 detections of six domestic animals and 23,825 detections of humans or their vehicles. Spatial differences across arrays explained more variation in the relative abundance than temporal variation across years for all 38 species modeled, although there are examples of significant site-level differences among years for many species. Temporal results show how species allocate their time and can be used to study species interactions, including between humans and wildlife. These data provide a snapshot of the mammal community of the USA for 2020 and will be useful for exploring the drivers of spatial and temporal changes in relative abundance and distribution, and the impacts of species interactions on daily activity patterns. There are no copyright restrictions, and please cite this paper when using these data, or a subset of these data, for publication."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe exclusion or local extirpation of native species by exotic or introduced carnivores is a burgeoning issue for conservation. Exotic carnivores may indeed present a serious threat as they have the potential to negatively influence and/or interact with native wildlife via exploitative or interference competition, intraguild predation and/or transmission of pathogens. So far, studies investigating co-occurrence have failed to include both a spatial and temporal component which is likely to lead to improper inference. Here, we used a novel approach to investigate the relationship between native and exotic carnivores across both space and time and provide insight on the spatial exclusion of the native spotted fanaloka, Fossa fossana (listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN), by the exotic small Indian civet, Viverricula indica , across Madagascar’s eastern rainforest ecosystem. We combined both spatial (single-species and two-species occupancy analyses) and temporal (kernel density estimation) analyses to investigate potential spatio-temporal interactions across the landscape, comparing degraded and non-degraded forests. We found that the exotic Indian civet negatively influenced spotted fanaloka occupancy, which resulted in a strong decrease in occupancy across degraded forests. Further, spotted fanaloka occupancy decreased by 40% at sites where Indian civet were present, resulting in a strong lack of co-occurrence between these two species. Finally, we recorded strong spatio-temporal overlap during the nocturnal time period within degraded, patchy forests. As a result, we suggest that this reveals evidence of spatial exclusion of the spotted fanaloka. This novel approach provides a unique investigation across both space and time – allowing us to identify more accurately the precise locations where co-occurring carnivores are potentially interacting – and has wide-ranging implications for conservation managers working to address the negative impacts of exotic species on native wildlife."

    "text": "Abstract\nOngoing declines in the imperiled New England cottontail Sylvilagus transitionalis have coincided with the introduction and expansion of the closely related eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus. These paired population trends have led to the inference of competition between the two species. Competition between native and introduced species has often involved overlapping use of food resources, but limited effort has been spent to analyze the diets of New England cottontail and eastern cottontail and to evaluate the potential for resource competition. We used microhistologic analysis of fecal pellets to assess the winter diets of both species and we compared diet composition with available plant communities to evaluate their preferences for dietary items across southern New England and southeastern New York. We found no differences in diets between New England cottontail and eastern cottontail, although diets did differ between regions within the study area. Diet preferences also were consistent between the species and largely excluded nonnative plant genera. Our results demonstrate that these species are generalist herbivores and that there is high potential for competition for food resources in the winter between them, although the present lack of diet partitioning may indicate the presence of other factors limiting competition. This study highlights the need for careful evaluation of interactions between native and nonnative species, a prerequisite for developing conservation plans that appropriately account for interspecific competition."

    "text": "Abstract\nReduced food availability is implicated in declines in avian aerial insectivores, but the effect of nutritional stress on mammalian aerial insectivores is unclear. Unlike birds, insectivorous bats provision their young through lactation, which might protect nursing juveniles when prey availability is low but could increase the energetic burden on lactating females. We analyzed a 15-year capture–mark–recapture data set from 5312 individual little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) captured at 11 maternity colonies in northwestern Canada, to test the hypothesis that nutritional stress is impacting these mammalian aerial insectivores. We used long-bone (forearm [FA]) length as a proxy for relative access to nutrition during development, and body mass as a proxy for access to nutrition prior to capture. Average FA length and body mass both decreased significantly over the study period in adult females and juveniles, suggesting decreased access to nutrition. Effect sizes were very small, similar to those reported for declining body size in avian aerial insectivores. Declines in juvenile body mass were only observed in individuals captured in late summer when they were foraging independently, supporting our hypothesis that lactation provides some protection to nursing young during periods of nutritional stress. Potential drivers of the decline in bat size include one or both of (1) declining insect (prey) abundance, and (2) declining prey availability. Echolocating insectivorous bats cannot forage effectively during rainfall, which is increasing in our study area. The body mass of captured adult females and juveniles in our study was lower, on average, after periods of high rainfall, and higher after warmer-than-average periods. Finally, survival models revealed a positive association between FA length and survival, suggesting a fitness consequence to declines in body size. Our study area has not yet been impacted by bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), but research elsewhere has suggested that fatter bats are more likely to survive infection. We found evidence for WNS-independent shifts in the body size of little brown myotis, which can inform studies investigating population responses to WNS. More broadly, the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (e.g., disease, nutritional stress, climate change, and other pressures) on mammalian aerial insectivores require urgent attention."

    "text": "Abstract\nIdentifying conservation actions to recover threatened species can be challenging due to many ecological uncertainties. For example, major threats to a species’ conservation are commonly known or suspected, but the specific impacts on population or metapopulation dynamics can be uncertain. This is frequently the case with emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis, a global driver of amphibian population declines caused by the fungal pathogens Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans. While these diseases are known to cause amphibian declines and extirpations, the mechanisms of their landscape-scale spread are still largely unknown. Such uncertainty can lead to inaction which may jeopardize timely recovery of a species. Decision analysis is a pragmatic approach to making transparent and defensible decisions while dealing with uncertainties. We investigated whether optimal actions aimed at recovering boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) metapopulations in the southern Rocky Mountains are robust to the unknown dynamics of Bd spread using value of information and regret analyses. Value of information is a decision-analytic tool for calculating the value of new information in terms of performance on management objectives, while regret measures the cost of acting under incorrect information. We further conducted a stochastic sensitivity analysis to identify the relative effects of metapopulation parameters on system dynamics. We found optimal actions were robust to the unknown dynamics of Bd spread. While boreal toad breeding occurrence is highly sensitive to Bd distribution, the optimal decision is not. Resolving the unknown dynamics of Bd spread would lead to a minimal gain of less than one breeding toad subpopulation at the end of 50 years, given the currently available management actions. Applying a decision-analytic framework coupled with value of information and regret analyses can help frame how uncertainties affect decisions in a way that empowers decision makers."

    "text": "Abstract\nHuman developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models, we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization. Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters. Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy was high, &gt;0.8, throughout much of the study area (49%), but we also found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would change occurrence status from season to season at ≈0.27 in the majority of the study area (70%). Our results show that although bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population."

    "text": "Abstract\nCurrent methods to model species habitat use through space and diel time are limited. Development of such models is critical when considering rapidly changing habitats where species are forced to adapt to anthropogenic change, often by shifting their diel activity across space. We use an occupancy modeling framework to specify the multistate diel occupancy model (MSDOM), which can evaluate species diel activity against continuous response variables that may impact diel activity within and across seasons or years. We used two case studies, fosas in Madagascar and coyotes in Chicago, Illinois, to conceptualize the application of this model and to quantify the impacts of human activity on species spatial use in diel time. We found support that both species varied their habitat use by diel states—in and across years and by human disturbance. Our results exemplify the importance of understanding animal diel activity patterns and how human disturbance can lead to temporal habitat loss. The MSDOM will allow more focused attention in ecology and evolution studies on the importance of the short temporal scale of diel time in animal-habitat relationships and lead to improved habitat conservation and management."

    "text": "Abstract\nManaging wildlife populations in the face of global change requires regular data on the abundance and distribution of wild animals, but acquiring these over appropriate spatial scales in a sustainable way has proven challenging. Here we present the data from Snapshot USA 2020, a second annual national mammal survey of the USA. This project involved 152 scientists setting camera traps in a standardized protocol at 1485 locations across 103 arrays in 43 states for a total of 52,710 trap-nights of survey effort. Most (58) of these arrays were also sampled during the same months (September and October) in 2019, providing a direct comparison of animal populations in 2 years that includes data from both during and before the COVID-19 pandemic. All data were managed by the eMammal system, with all species identifications checked by at least two reviewers. In total, we recorded 117,415 detections of 78 species of wild mammals, 9236 detections of at least 43 species of birds, 15,851 detections of six domestic animals and 23,825 detections of humans or their vehicles. Spatial differences across arrays explained more variation in the relative abundance than temporal variation across years for all 38 species modeled, although there are examples of significant site-level differences among years for many species. Temporal results show how species allocate their time and can be used to study species interactions, including between humans and wildlife. These data provide a snapshot of the mammal community of the USA for 2020 and will be useful for exploring the drivers of spatial and temporal changes in relative abundance and distribution, and the impacts of species interactions on daily activity patterns.

    "text": "Abstract\nIn many regions of the world, forest management has reduced old forest and simplified forest structure and composition. We hypothesized that such forest degradation has resulted in long-term habitat loss for forest-associated bird species of eastern Canada (130,017 km2) which, in turn, has caused bird-population declines. Despite little change in overall forest cover, we found substantial reductions in old forest as a result of frequent clear-cutting and a broad-scale transformation to intensified forestry. Back-cast species distribution models revealed that breeding habitat loss occurred for 66% of the 54 most common species from 1985 to 2020 and was strongly associated with reduction in old age classes. Using a long-term, independent dataset, we found that habitat amount predicted population size for 94% of species, and habitat loss was associated with population declines for old-forest species. Forest degradation may therefore be a primary cause of biodiversity decline in managed forest landscapes."

This data set includes nine distinct protected areas of Madagascar and encompasses 13 subprojects, 38 camera arrays, and 1156 sampling units (independent camera site per survey) within two important biodiversity eco-regions: western dry deciduous forest and eastern humid rainforest. Camera surveys were conducted from June 2007 to January 2021. The final data set includes 17 unique families of mammals (Bovidae, Canidae, Cheirogaleidae, Daubentoniidae, Equidae, Eupleridae, Felidae, Hominidae, Indriidae, Lemuridae, Lepilemuridae, Muridae, Nesomyidae, Pteropodidae, Soricidae, Suidae, Tenrecidae) comprising 45 species and 27 unique families of birds (Accipitridae, Acrocephalidae, Alcedinidae, Bernieridae, Brachypteraciidae, Caprimulgidae, Cisticolidae, Columbidae, Coraciidae, Corvidae, Cuculidae, Dicruridae, Mesitornithidae, Monarchidae, Motacillidae, Muscicapidae, Numididae, Phasianidae, Rallidae, Sarothruridae, Strigidae, Sturnidae, Sulidae, Threskiornithidae, Upupidae, Vangidae, Zosteropidae) comprising 58 species. Images were processed and verified by individual project data set creators and camera operation and species tables were then collated. The final product represents the first broad-scale freely available standardized formal faunal database for Madagascar. Data are available through this publication and at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5801806.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nWildlife road mortality tends to aggregate spatially at locations commonly referred to as road mortality hotspots. Predictive models can be used to identify locations appropriate for mitigation measures that reduce road mortality. However, the influence of imperfect detection (e.g., false absences) during road mortality surveys can lead to inaccurate or imprecise spatial patterns of road mortality hotspots and suboptimal implementation of mitigation measures. In this research, we used amphibians and reptiles as a case study to address imperfect detection issues when estimating the probability of road mortality hotspots using occupancy detection modeling. In addition, we determined the survey effort needed to achieve a high probability of detecting large roadkill events. We also assessed whether vehicle travel reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions led to reductions in road mortality. We conducted surveys at 48 sites throughout Rhode Island, USA, from 2019–2021. In total, we observed 657 carcasses representing 19 of Rhode Island’s 37 native species. Of the 19 native species, eight species of frogs, four species of salamanders, four species of snakes, and three species of turtles were observed. We documented a reduction in roadkill density and the proportion of dead versus live amphibians and reptiles in pandemic years (2020 and 2021), but we were unable to link reductions in roadkill density to reductions in traffic volume. Our model results indicated that large roadkill events were more likely to occur on roads near wetlands and with low traffic volume and were more likely to be detected as daily precipitation increased. We determined that there was a low probability of detecting large roadkill events, suggesting that imperfect detection influences detection of large roadkill events, and many were likely missed during our surveys. Therefore, we recommend using occupancy modeling to account for the influence of imperfect detection when estimating road mortality hotspots. This approach will more effectively guide the implementation of mitigation measures."

    "text": "Abstract\nTime is a fundamental component of ecological processes. How animal behavior changes over time has been explored through well-known ecological theories like niche partitioning and predator–prey dynamics. Yet, changes in animal behavior within the shorter 24-hr light–dark cycle have largely gone unstudied. Understanding if an animal can adjust their temporal activity to mitigate or adapt to environmental change has become a recent topic of discussion and is important for effective wildlife management and conservation. While spatial habitat is a fundamental consideration in wildlife management and conservation, temporal habitat is often ignored. We formulated a temporal resource selection model to quantify the diel behavior of 8 mammal species across 10 US cities. We found high variability in diel activity patterns within and among species and species-specific correlations between diel activity and human population density, impervious land cover, available greenspace, vegetation cover, and mean daily temperature. We also found that some species may modulate temporal behaviors to manage both natural and anthropogenic risks. Our results highlight the complexity with which temporal activity patterns interact with local environmental characteristics, and suggest that urban mammals may use time along the 24-hr cycle to reduce risk, adapt, and therefore persist, and in some cases thrive, in human-dominated ecosystems."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTropical biodiversity is threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly forest degradation and overhunting. Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed dispersers). However, these species are disproportionally affected by overhunting for wildlife trade markets and are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Few studies have examined spatiotemporal responses to anthropogenic disturbance by mesomammals at the community level, which may identify imbalances within an ecosystem that could threaten species persistence. We deployed camera traps throughout Cat Tien National Park (i.e., Nam Cat Tien area), southern Vietnam, to (1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and (2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community within a historically disturbed tropical forest using hierarchical Bayesian community occupancy models. We found that site occupancy was driven by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). This may be due to the combination of intact forest benefits (refuge from predators and hunters, denning sites) and early successional grassland resources (forage quality), as well as high levels of tolerance for disturbed forest among the largely generalist mesomammal community of Nam Cat Tien. We found no negative effects of current anthropogenic factors at the community level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remain an acute threat to native mesomammals. Without continued efforts to address the unsustainable harvest of wildlife, Southeast Asian’s remaining mesomammals are at risk of extirpation despite resilience to moderate levels of disturbance."

    "text": "Abstract\nHabitat selection is a fundamental animal behavior that shapes a wide range of ecological processes, including animal movement, nutrient transfer, trophic dynamics and population distribution. Although habitat selection has been a focus of ecological studies for decades, technological, conceptual and methodological advances over the last 20 yr have led to a surge in studies addressing this process. Despite the substantial literature focused on quantifying the habitat-selection patterns of animals, there is a marked lack of guidance on best analytical practices. The conceptual foundations of the most commonly applied modeling frameworks can be confusing even to those well versed in their application. Furthermore, there has yet to be a synthesis of the advances made over the last 20 yr. Therefore, there is a need for both synthesis of the current state of knowledge on habitat selection, and guidance for those seeking to study this process. Here, we provide an approachable overview and synthesis of the literature on habitat-selection analyses (HSAs) conducted using selection functions, which are by far the most applied modeling framework for understanding the habitat-selection process. This review is purposefully non-technical and focused on understanding without heavy mathematical and statistical notation, which can confuse many practitioners. We offer an overview and history of HSAs, describing the tortuous conceptual path to our current understanding. Through this overview, we also aim to address the areas of greatest confusion in the literature. We synthesize the literature outlining the most exciting conceptual advances in the field of habitat-selection modeling, discussing the substantial ecological and evolutionary inference that can be made using contemporary techniques. We aim for this paper to provide clarity for those navigating the complex literature on HSAs while acting as a reference and best practices guide for practitioners."

We trapped Bobcats across 5 field seasons from April 2015 to March 2019, totaling 2232 trap nights. We captured 8 Bobcats, equipped GPS collars to a subset (n = 3), and collected locations for 4 to 9 months. We used GPS locations to estimate annual and seasonal home-range size and individual-level seasonal resource selection within the home range for each individual. Further, we used tissue samples collected from trapped individuals and opportunistically collected roadkill (n = 30) to examine the population genetic structure and effective population size of Bobcats in the state. We found the mean winter and summer home-range sizes were 219.3 km2 and 51.7 km2, respectively. Bobcats selected for forested wetland habitats and were associated with areas closer to wetlands and young forests, according to resource-selection models. They also selected for areas with higher road densities, yet avoided developed areas. We found that Bobcats in Rhode Island are part of 1 genetic population and estimated their effective population size to be 82 individuals (95% CI: 44–329). Our study highlights the importance of examining a widely distributed species at a local scale in order to employ evidence-based management practices."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMadagascar’s native carnivorans are an endemic monophyletic group of eight extant species belonging to the family Eupleridae. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently classifies seven of the species as threatened (Vulnerable or Endangered), as their populations are in decline due to intensifying anthropogenic pressures. However, little is known about these species’ ecology and population trends, precluding forecasts of extinction risk. Life-history and functional traits govern species’ responses to environmental pressure and can be predictive of extinction risk. Incorporating relevant trait information can vastly improve risk assessments. Yet, information on the life-history and functional traits of the Eupleridae has never been compiled into a single framework. Our aims were to: 1) synthesise the current state of knowledge of the life-history and functional traits of euplerid species, 2) review empirical evidence of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on species, and 3) identify knowledge gaps and future research needs. We searched the published literature to compile life-history and functional trait information and known effects of anthropogenic pressures for Eupleridae. Our review indicates that Madagascar’s carnivorans have high-risk life-history and functional traits that increase their vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures. Publications reported negative effects on euplerids from habitat degradation and fragmentation, logging, non-native carnivorans, disease, and hunting and retaliatory killings. However, our synthesis revealed significant knowledge gaps, especially in species’ life-history traits and in the spatial variability in most traits. For most species, we currently do not have the robust data needed to assess trait-based risk dynamics. The culmination of reported traits, negative influence of ongoing anthropogenic pressures, and lack of robust metrics (e.g. population trends and trait variability) indicate that euplerids are at high risk, yet may reach the cusp of extinction without notice due to significant gaps in knowledge. Future research should prioritise filling gaps in knowledge of influential traits, evaluating anthropogenic pressures, and integrating trait information to improve risk assessments and extinction forecasts."

    "text": "Abstract\nWith the accelerating pace of global change, it is imperative that we obtain rapid inventories of the status and distribution of wildlife for ecological inferences and conservation planning. To address this challenge, we launched the SNAPSHOT USA project, a collaborative survey of terrestrial wildlife populations using camera traps across the United States. For our first annual survey, we compiled data across all 50 states during a 14-week period (17 August–24 November of 2019). We sampled wildlife at 1,509 camera trap sites from 110 camera trap arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across four development zones. This effort resulted in 166,036 unique detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. All images were processed through the Smithsonian’s eMammal camera trap data repository and included an expert review phase to ensure taxonomic accuracy of data, resulting in each picture being reviewed at least twice. The results represent a timely and standardized camera trap survey of the United States. All of the 2019 survey data are made available herein. We are currently repeating surveys in fall 2020, opening up the opportunity to other institutions and cooperators to expand coverage of all the urban–wild gradients and ecophysiographic regions of the country. Future data will be available as the database is updated at eMammal.si.edu/snapshot-usa, as will future data paper submissions. These data will be useful for local and macroecological research including the examination of community assembly, effects of environmental and anthropogenic landscape variables, effects of fragmentation and extinction debt dynamics, as well as species-specific population dynamics and conservation action plans.

    "text": "Abstract\nAnthropogenic habitat modification is a major driver of global biodiversity loss. In North America, one of the primary sources of habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas development on winter range in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, USA, from 2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels of hydrocarbon development within the Piceance Basin.\nWe assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, December fawn mass, adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal counts, and lactation rates in December between the 2 study areas. Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree. Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival; however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these mechanisms.\nGiven our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic, light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system, minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria). Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of how wildlife respond to habitat modification."

    "text": "Abstract\nMadagascar is an island nation renowned for its biodiversity and species endemism, yet it is still largely understudied despite intense anthropogenic threats including forest loss and edge effects. Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve is a recently expanded rainforest protected area that is lacking detailed surveys and assessments of the native carnivore community of the endemic family Eupleridae. To identify which terrestrial carnivores occupy the reserve and what anthropogenic disturbances and factors best explain their occurrence patterns, we deployed 35 motion-activated cameras to detect native and introduced carnivores. From November 2018 to February 2019, we collected 2918 unique capture events (all species) and confirmed the presence of 5 euplerids: Galidia elegans, Galidictis fasciata, Eupleres goudotii, Fossa fossana, and Cryptoprocta ferox. These results extend the known range of E. goudotii and G. fasciata. In the reserve, F. fossana and G. elegans were the most common and widespread native carnivores, while E. goudotii was the rarest. We highlight the negative impact of edge effects on G. fasciata and F. fossana and the threat posed by the free-ranging non-native carnivore C. familiaris. This study represents the first detailed survey and occurrence estimates of the carnivore community of this protected area, allowing comparison with other protected areas in Madagascar. Our empirical findings show that anthropogenic disturbance negatively impacts carnivore existence within the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve and provide important management recommendations for protecting the carnivore community and the co-occurring wildlife living within this area."

We tested whether breeding site occupancy of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) was driven by the synergistic effects of nesting habitat loss in forests, and changing ocean conditions. We paired 70,700 murrelet surveys at 19,837 sites across 20 years from the Oregon Coast Range with annual data on the extent of old forest and biophysical ocean conditions. Dynamic occupancy models indicated that local murrelet colonization rates were strongly reduced during warm ocean conditions with low prey availability. Landscapes that contained more old forest and were closer to the ocean showed reduced rates of local extinction. Given predictions of accelerated ocean warming and increased global timber demand, our results suggest murrelets may continue to be imperiled by deterioration of the two habitats upon which they depend."

Continued climate change will likely have a positive effect on summer survival but a negative effect on winter survival. This potentially has wide-ranging consequences across other species occupying temperate to more extreme arctic and alpine habitats, which are also where the most rapid changes in climate are observed."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAvian electrocutions on power poles affect raptor populations globally. Mitigation strategies in the USA are typically bottom-up, combining risk assessments for individual poles into a utility-specific avian protection plan. This approach is usually reactive, relying on incidental documentation of electrocutions for initiation, and can allow uncoordinated mitigation strategies among adjacent utilities. A top-down strategy may help solve both problems if maps identifying where distribution power poles occur were available for comparison to range maps for species at risk of electrocution. Range maps exist but pole location data are rarely publicly available in the USA. Pole-density models were previously created for Colorado and Wyoming, the Great Basin, and the Columbia Plateau because pole density can serve as a surrogate for electrocution risk. We used each of these models to predict pole densities throughout four additional areas: the Northwestern Plains, Southwestern Plains, Southwestern Plateaus, and parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas. We also applied the Colorado and Wyoming model to portions of the Uinta Basin and Wyoming Basin projecting from Colorado and Wyoming into Idaho and Utah. The Colorado and Wyoming model fit all areas better than other models, except parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas, where the Great Basin model fit best. Our model predictions facilitate assessment of pole density across much (2,573,746 km2) of the western USA. To assess whether the models are useful in predicting electrocutions, we compared predicted pole densities throughout White Sands Missile Range to locations of 59 avian electrocutions. Electrocutions occurred at low rates in cells with low predicted pole densities, and at higher rates in cells with moderate and high predicted pole densities. Because the models do not include species-specific information, they have the potential to be applicable to the conservation of a wide variety of species."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nStudies of elusive carnivores often rely on passive sampling when investigating either spatial or temporal interactions. However, inference on behavioral mechanisms are usually lacking. We present an analysis that combines previously published spatial co-occurrence estimates and temporal kernel density estimates to explore spatiotemporal interspecific interactions. We do so by deriving a spatiotemporal value (STV) that is a relative measure of potential interaction in both niche dimensions, across a gradient of degradation, for rainforest carnivore pairs in Madagascar. We also use a conceptual framework to provide insight into the potential behavioral mechanisms of habitat selection. Of the six native and three invasive carnivores, we estimate the spatiotemporal interactions for twelve pairings, which range from no spatial/temporal relationship (n = 5) to spatiotemporal aggregation or segregation (n = 7). We visualized these spatiotemporal interactions along a fragmentation gradient and demonstrate that these interactions are not static, as STV overlap increases with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Of the three invasive carnivores (free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris, cats Felis species, and small Indian civets Viverricula indica) the latter had the highest number of spatial occurrence (n = 4) and spatiotemporal overlap (n = 4) relationships with native carnivores. Our results highlight the potential for increasing direct and indirect interactions between native and invasive species as forest degradation and invasive predators increase. Our approach allows us to better understand adaptive behaviors, plasticity in temporal activity, community assemblage, and to develop targeted conservation strategies to manage ecological communities in rapidly changing ecosystems."

    "text": "Abstract\nResource selection is often studied by ecologists interested in the environmental drivers of animal space use and movement. These studies commonly produce spatial predictions, which are of considerable utility to resource managers making habitat and population management decisions. It is thus paramount that predictions from resource selection studies are accurate. We evaluated model building and fitting strategies for optimizing resource selection function predictions in a use-availability framework. We did so by simulating low- and high-intensity spatial sampling data that respectively predicted study area and movement-based resource selection. We compared one of the most commonly used forms of statistical regularization, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), with the lesser used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). LASSO predictions were less variable and more accurate than AIC and were often best when considering additive and interacting variables. We explicitly demonstrate the predictive equivalence using the logistic and Poisson likelihoods and how it is lost when the available sample is too small. Regardless of modeling approach, interpreting the sign of coefficients as a measure of selection can be misleading when optimizing for prediction."

    "text": "Abstract\nRanging behavior is one important strategy by which nonhuman primates obtain access to resources critical to their biological maintenance and reproductive success. As most primates live in permanent social groups, their members must balance the benefits of group living with the costs of intragroup competition for resources. However, some taxa live in more spatiotemporally flexible social groups, whose members modify patterns of association and range use as a method to mitigate these costs. Here, we describe the range use of one such taxon, the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), at an undisturbed primary rain forest site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and characterize sex differences in annual home range area, overlap, and daily distances traveled. Moreover, we characterize seasonal variability in range use and ask whether ranging behaviors can be explained by either climatic or reproductive seasonality. We found that females used significantly larger home ranges than males, though sexes shared equal and moderate levels of home range overlap. Overall, range use did not vary across seasons, although within sexes, male range use varied significantly with climate. Moreover, daily path length was best predicted by day length, female reproductive state, and sex, but was unrelated to climate variables. While the patterns of range use and spatial association presented here share some similarities with “bisexually bonded” community models described for chimpanzees, we argue that ruffed lemurs best conform to a “nuclear neighborhood” community model wherein nuclear (core) groups share the highest levels of home range overlap, and where these groups cluster spatially into adjacent “neighborhoods” within the larger, communally defended territory."

Understanding the adaptive selection for site fidelity patterns provides a mechanistic understanding to both spatial and population processes. This can be achieved by linking space use with environmental variability (spatial and temporal) and demographic parameters. However, rarely is the environmental context that drives the selection for site fidelity behaviour fully considered.\nWe use ecological theory to understand whether the spatial and temporal variability in breeding site quality can explain the site fidelity behaviour and demographic patterns of Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus). We examined female site fidelity patterns across multiple spatial scales: proximity of consecutive year nest locations, space-use overlap within and across the breeding and brooding seasons, and fidelity to a breeding patch. We also examined the spatial and temporal variability in nest, chick, juvenile and adult survival.\nWe found Gunnison sage-grouse to be site faithful to their breeding patch, area of use within the patch and generally where they nest, suggesting an “Always Stay” site fidelity strategy. This is an optimal evolutionary strategy when site quality is unpredictable. Further, we found limited spatial variability in survival within age groups, suggesting little demographic benefit to moving among patches. We suggest Gunnison sage-grouse site fidelity is driven by the unpredictability of predation in a relatively homogeneous environment, the lack of benefits and likely costs to moving across landscape patches and leaving known lek and breeding/brooding areas.\nSpace use and demography are commonly studied separately. More so, site fidelity patterns are rarely framed in the context of ecological theory, beyond questions related to the win-stay:lose-switch rule. To move beyond describing patterns and understand the adaptive selection driving species movements and their demographic consequences require integrating movement, demography and environmental variability in a synthetic framework. Site fidelity theory provides a coherent framework to simultaneously investigate the spatial and population ecology of animal populations. Using it to frame ecological questions will lead to a more mechanistic understanding of animal movement, spatial population structuring and meta-population dynamics."

By combining detections across multiple surveys, or using informative priors in Bayesian model fitting, researchers can improve parameter estimation from sparse capture–recapture data. Using a spatial mark–resight model that incorporates site-level heterogeneity in the spatial scale parameter via a hierarchical process and prior information, we estimated the density of a threatened carnivore (fosa, Cryptoprocta ferox) from multiple sparse datasets collected during extensive camera trapping surveys in northeastern Madagascar (2008–2015). Our objectives were to estimate density for six sites, examine the response of fosa density and movement to habitat degradation, monitor annual density trends across 7 years at two sites, and estimate fosa abundance in the Makira–Masoala protected area complex. We obtained a mean of 16.1 (se = 0.52; range = 2–49) fosa detections and three observers identified a mean of 3.62 (se = 0.09; range = 1–8) marked individuals per survey. Fosa daily baseline encounter rate was very low (λ0 = 0.004; 0.003–0.006) and density/movement estimates were similar across forest types. Density estimates at resurveyed sites suggested annual variability in density, with estimates trending lower during the final surveys [e.g. D = 0.39 (0.14–1.11) versus 0.08 (0.05–0.31) individuals per km2]. We estimated fosa abundance across the Makira–Masoala region to be 1061 (95% HPDI: 596–1780) adult individuals. On the basis of our estimate and the size of the region, we believe Makira–Masoala harbors a significant portion of the global fosa population. The conservation and management of rare species is commonly limited due to lack of population estimates. By combining detections across surveys, we overcame estimation issues and obtained valuable information on a threatened carnivore, allowing us to better assess its status and prioritize conservation actions. We advocate for practical use of sparse datasets for such data-deficient species."

Animal telemetry technology has revolutionized the fields of ecology and conservation biology by providing high quality spatial data on animal movement. Radio-telemetry with very high frequency (VHF) radio signals continues to be a useful technology because of its low cost, miniaturization, and low battery requirements. Despite a number of statistical developments synthetically integrating animal location estimation and uncertainty with spatial process models using satellite telemetry data, we are unaware of similar developments for azimuthal telemetry data. As such, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models.\nWe developed a hierarchical modeling framework to provide robust animal location estimates from one or more intersecting or non-intersecting azimuths. We used our azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into spatial ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators (Lenth (1981) maximum likelihood and M-Estimators) using simulation. We also provide illustrative empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We further use simulation to better understand the relationship among location uncertainty, spatial covariate autocorrelation, and resource selection inference."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe proliferation of forest edges and invasive predators have been identified as two primary threats to carnivore populations globally. These threats often occur in unison, facilitated by anthropogenic activities (e.g., fragmentation), and together may pose a greater influence than when they occur separately. Targeted conservation actions for forest carnivores, including Madagascar carnivores, have been hindered by a failure to understand the relative contributions of these factors in driving species declines. To fill this gap, we conducted an extensive camera survey along the edge of intact, continuous protected rainforests in eastern Madagascar to evaluate the extent invasive predators and forest edge separately and in combination affect native carnivore space use. We hypothesized that structural vegetation changes at the forest edge interact with invasive predator trap success and occurrence to reduce native carnivore space use near the forest edge and separately have less influence than when combined. In contrast to findings in fragmented and degraded forests of Madagascar, we found hard forest edge and invasive predators alone do not indiscriminately reduce native carnivore space use in continuous intact forest. Instead, we found free-roaming dogs and cats interact with their surrounding environment (i.e., forest edge) in unique ways that shape species response differently than within interior forest. At the forest edge, vegetational changes of increasing shrub cover and the occurrence of dogs reduce space use of three of four native carnivores. However, we found greater effects of proximity to villages, especially with high invasive predator activity (free-roaming cats). Ultimately, native carnivores showed variable sensitivities to pressures we examined, providing support for species-specific management actions to maximize conservation outcomes. We encourage future studies to consider evaluating the magnitude of separate and combined threats to carnivores. In doing so, conservationists can better identify when threats can be managed in isolation and when they require simultaneous mitigation."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe distribution of mammals is determined by a suite of endogenous and exogenous factors. In territorial, polygynous species like tigers (Panthera tigris), males often center their space-use around female territories, repelling competitors from these areas. Competition among males for females leads to increased mortality of both sexes and infanticide of unrelated cubs, which can lead to population declines. We hypothesized that increased territorial overlap among adult male tigers and elevated levels of inter and intra-sex competition would be manifest in populations with male-biased adult sex ratios (ASR). We also assessed whether inter-sex variation in adult survival or degree of habitat connectivity resulted in skewed ASR. We evaluated these hypotheses using camera trap data from three tiger populations occupying habitat patches with varying levels of connectivity and ASRs. Data were analyzed using multi-state occupancy models, where states were defined as habitat use by one or more male tigers in sites with and without female use. As predicted, in populations with male-biased or even ASR we found evidence for increased spatial overlap between male tigers, particularly pronounced in areas adjacent to female territories. Given parity in adult survival, habitat fragmentation likely caused male-biased ASR. Our results suggest that the persistence of small tiger populations in habitat patches with male-biased ASR may be significantly compromised by behavior-mediated endogenous demographic processes that are often overlooked. In habitat fragments with pronounced male biased ASR, population recovery of territorial carnivores may require timely supplementation of individuals to compensate for population losses from intraspecific competition."

We investigate the benefits of collaboratively monitoring the abundance and survival of the critically endangered Amur leopard, which occurs as a single transboundary population across China and Russia. Country-specific results overestimated abundance and were generally less precise compared to integrated monitoring estimates; the global population was similar in both years: 84 (70–108, 95% confidence interval). Uncertainty in country-specific annual survival estimates were approximately twice the integrated estimates of 0.82 (0.69–0.91, 95% confidence limits). This collaborative effort provided a better understanding of Amur leopard population dynamics, represented a first step in building trust, and lead to cooperative agreements to coordinate conservation policies."

    "text": "Abstract\nConservation and management decision making in natural resources is challenging due to numerous uncertainties and unknowns, especially relating to understanding system dynamics. Adaptive resource management (ARM) is a formal process to making logical and transparent recurrent decisions when there are uncertainties about system dynamics. Despite wide recognition and calls for implementing adaptive natural resource management, applications remain limited. More common is a reactive approach to decision making, which ignores future system dynamics. This contrasts with ARM, which anticipates future dynamics of ecological process and management actions using a model-based framework. Practitioners may be reluctant to adopt ARM because of the dearth of comparative evaluations between ARM and more common approaches to making decisions. We compared the probability of meeting management objectives when managing a population under both types of decision frameworks, specifically in relation to typical uncertainties and unknowns. We use a population of Sandhill Cranes as our case study. We evaluate each decision process under varying levels of monitoring and ecological uncertainty, where the true underlying population dynamics followed a stochastic age-structured population model with environmentally driven vital rate density dependence. We found that the ARM framework outperformed the currently employed reactive decision framework to manage Sandhill Cranes in meeting the population objective across an array of scenarios. This was even the case when the candidate set of population models contained only naïve representations of the true population process. Under the reactive decision framework, we found little improvement in meeting the population objective even if monitoring uncertainty was eliminated. In contrast, if the population was monitored without error within the ARM framework, the population objective was always maintained, regardless of the population models considered. Contrary to expectation, we found that age-specific optimal harvest decisions are not always necessary to meet a population objective when population dynamics are age structured. Population managers can decrease risks and gain transparency and flexibility in management by adopting an ARM framework. If population monitoring data has high sampling variation and/or limited empirical knowledge is available for constructing mechanistic population models, ARM model sets should consider a range of mechanistic, descriptive, and predictive model types."

The EID chytridiomycosis is a prominent driver of amphibian declines, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). To guide conservation policy, we developed a predictive decision-analytic model that combines empirical knowledge of host-pathogen metapopulation dynamics with expert judgment regarding effects of management actions, to select from potential conservation strategies. We apply our approach to a boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) and Bd system, identifying optimal strategies that balance tradeoffs in maximizing toad population persistence and landscape-level distribution, while considering costs. The most robust strategy is expected to reduce the decline of toad breeding sites from 53% to 21% over 50 years. Our findings are incorporated into management policy to guide conservation planning. Our online modeling application provides a template for managers of other systems challenged by EIDs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nUnderstanding patterns of species occurrence and the processes underlying these patterns is fundamental to the study of ecology. One of the more commonly used approaches to investigate species occurrence patterns is occupancy modeling, which can account for imperfect detection of a species during surveys. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of Bayesian modeling in ecology, which includes fitting Bayesian occupancy models. The Bayesian framework is appealing to ecologists for many reasons, including the ability to incorporate prior information through the specification of prior distributions on parameters. While ecologists almost exclusively intend to choose priors so that they are “uninformative” or “vague”, such priors can easily be unintentionally highly informative. Here we report on how the specification of a “vague” normally distributed (i.e., Gaussian) prior on coefficients in Bayesian occupancy models can unintentionally influence parameter estimation. Using both simulated data and empirical examples, we illustrate how this issue likely compromises inference about species-habitat relationships. While the extent to which these informative priors influence inference depends on the data set, researchers fitting Bayesian occupancy models should conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure intended inference, or employ less commonly used priors that are less informative (e.g., logistic or t prior distributions). We provide suggestions for addressing this issue in occupancy studies, and an online tool for exploring this issue under different contexts."

The only remaining individuals live as part of a small population isolated in a single protected area, Ujung Kulon National Park, Java, Indonesia. Despite almost a century of studies, little is known about the factors that affect Javan rhino demography and distribution. National park officials require such information to identify conservation strategies and track the success and failures of these efforts; translocating selected individuals to establish a second population has been considered, but the risks must be weighed. We show that the 2013 global population of Javan rhinos was 62 individuals, which is likely near the site’s carrying capacity. Our analysis of rhino distribution indicates that tsunamis are a significant risk to the species in Ujung Kulon, justifying the risks of establishing additional populations. Continued individual-based monitoring is needed to guide future translocation decisions."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMadagascar is home to the smallest primates in the world, the mouse lemurs (Microcebus species). Twenty-four species of mouse lemur are currently recognised and are found in variable ecosystems, from dry forests and spiny deserts to humid forests. Due to their widespread distribution and the large number of sympatric species, mouse lemurs can be used as a model to understand the linkages among species richness, population density, and habitat. As all lemurs are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, this information can also be used to inform conservation management. We hypothesise that on an island-wide scale, we will find higher population densities in western dry forests than in eastern humid forests because the western dry forests exhibit lower species richness, more sympatric habitat use, and lower resource stability than the eastern humid forests. We conducted a literature review of population density estimates of known mouse lemur species, and used those data to conduct a meta-analysis and estimate overall average population density by geographic region.\nOur findings suggest that mouse lemur species living in western dry forest generally exhibit higher densities than those in eastern humid forests. This may be partly explained by higher habitat fragmentation in western dry forests, where species co-occur, but is likely to be a function of the magnitude and variability in seasonally available resources in each forest type. Higher seasonality results in less constant food availability and lower levels of environmental predictability, fostering species capable of coping with environmental change and maintaining high densities throughout periods of resource paucity.\nOur study highlights the importance of conducting Microcebus population density research that adheres to standardised methodological approaches. We point to the need for population density estimates for several species for which data are lacking. Such knowledge is important to assess the conservation status of these species, but also to enhance our ability to identify the macro-biogeographical and local ecological drivers of interspecific and intraspecific variability in population density."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe effect of climate on the population dynamics of rainforest vertebrates is known only for a limited subset of species and study locations. To extend this knowledge, we carried out an 8-year population study of a Viverrid (Malay civet Viverra tangalunga) in the Wallacea biogeographical region (Buton Island, Sulawesi). Civets were trapped annually from 2003 to 2010, during which there were four weak to moderate El Niño events and one moderate La Niña event. In Indonesia, El Niño events are associated with drier than normal conditions, while La Niña is associated with wetter conditions. The number of individuals captured was strongly correlated with the 12-month summed Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) prior to trapping, with significantly fewer individuals caught in years with lower summed SOI (i.e. stronger El Niño conditions). Adult civet body mass was significantly higher in El Niño years; mean adult male and female body masses were 10.6% and 4.0% greater in El Niño years. There was support for a 1-year time lagged effect of El Niño on the apparent survival (1 – probability of disappearing from the study site due to death or emigration) of male (but not female) civets, which was approximately 50% higher in the year following El Niño events. Using spatially explicit capture–mark–recapture models, we were unable to detect any significant change in civet density between years, which was estimated as 1.36 ± 0.14 (se) individuals km−2. We suggest that increased apparent survival of males observed in the year after El Niño events was brought about by reduced dispersal (possibly associated with a change in mating tactic) rather than reduced mortality."

    "text": "Abstract\nProtected areas (PA) aim to eliminate many of the threats that species face on the greater landscape. In the last three decades, PA’s have expanded considerably; however, quantitative assessments of how well they have mitigated threats to habitat and biodiversity are very limited. Habitat bordering PA’s and the wildlife that use it are threatened by a wide-range of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., edge effects, fragmentation, and introduced predators) and this situation is particularly acute for low-density, poorly studied carnivore communities. From 2010 to 2015, we photographically sampled within (contiguous forest) and bordering (degraded, fragmented forest) a UNESCO World Heritage rainforest PA in Madagascar - Ranomafana National Park (RNP). We investigated the effects of invasive predators, local people presence, and habitat quality on the endemic rainforest carnivore community using static, dynamic, and co-occurrence models. We found native carnivores to be absent or have a low probability of occurrence in degraded forest bordering the PA, while local people and dogs (Canis familiaris) had high occurrence. Madagascar’s largest endemic carnivore, the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the much smaller ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans), occurrence in RNP declined rapidly over six years; their strong co-occurrence with dogs suggests interspecific competition, direct aggression/mortality, or disease as the cause. We highlight the dangers posed to biodiversity, particularly carnivores, from anthropogenic pressures bordering PA’s and present recommendations to address increased human and dog activity, including programs to control dogs and their impact on biodiversity."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMonitoring animal populations can be difficult. Limited resources often force monitoring programs to rely on unadjusted or smoothed counts as an index of abundance. Smoothing counts is commonly done using a moving-average estimator to dampen sampling variation. These indices are commonly used to inform management decisions, although their reliability is often unknown. We outline a process to evaluate the biological plausibility of annual changes in population counts and indices from a typical monitoring scenario and compare results with a hierarchical Bayesian time series (HBTS) model. We evaluated spring and fall counts, fall indices, and model-based predictions for the Rocky Mountain population (RMP) of Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis) by integrating juvenile recruitment, harvest, and survival into a stochastic stage-based population model. We used simulation to evaluate population indices from the HBTS model and the commonly used 3-yr moving average estimator. We found counts of the RMP to exhibit biologically unrealistic annual change, while the fall population index was largely biologically realistic. HBTS model predictions suggested that the RMP changed little over 31 yr of monitoring, but the pattern depended on assumptions about the observational process. The HBTS model fall population predictions were biologically plausible if observed crane harvest mortality was compensatory up to natural mortality, as empirical evidence suggests. Simulations indicated that the predicted mean of the HBTS model was generally a more reliable estimate of the true population than population indices derived using a moving 3-yr average estimator. Practitioners could gain considerable advantages from modeling population counts using a hierarchical Bayesian autoregressive approach. Advantages would include: (1) obtaining measures of uncertainty; (2) incorporating direct knowledge of the observational and population processes; (3) accommodating missing years of data; and (4) forecasting population size."

These models can be parameterized using empirical data, but sometimes require information elicited from experts. When evaluating the effects of disease in species translocation programs, expert judgment is likely to play a role because complete empirical information will rarely be available. We illustrate development of a decision-analytic model built to inform decision-making regarding translocations and other management actions for the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas), a species with declines linked to chytridiomycosis caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Using the model, we explored the management implications of major uncertainties in this system, including whether there is a genetic basis for resistance to pathogenic infection by Bd, how translocation can best be implemented, and the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the spread of Bd. Our modeling exercise suggested that while selection for resistance to pathogenic infection by Bd could increase numbers of sites occupied by toads, and translocations could increase the rate of toad recovery, efforts to reduce the spread of Bd may have little effect. We emphasize the need to continue developing and parameterizing models necessary to assess management actions for combating chytridiomycosis-associated declines."

    "text": "Abstract\nBiological invasions can represent important threats to endemic species, including those within the invaders’ food webs. The Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) was introduced to Madagascar in 2011. This introduction presents a potentially dangerous prey item to a relatively naïve, highly diverse endemic carnivore fauna. Using a multivariate niche modeling approach (background test), we assessed the predicted niche overlap between D. melanostictus and six endemic carnivores in eastern Madagascar. The overlap between this potential prey and predators was assessed on four environmental niche axes: temperature, precipitation, vegetation cover and elevation. Our results showed a mixture of niche overlap and divergence between D. melanostictus and the six carnivores for environmental axes tested. There was significant overlap with five of the carnivores on temperature and NDVI axes. On the precipitation axis, there was significant overlap between D. melanostictus with two species. Our results suggested that wide-ranging, locally rare carnivores may overlap extensively with D. melanostictus. The six carnivores that inhabit the eastern rainforest of Madagascar will likely share multiple, niche axes with this novel potential prey item. Species that eat the non-native common toad and are susceptible to its toxins are at conservation risk because their populations may not be robust enough to adapt quickly to this threat. We advocate closely monitoring these emerging interactions and suggest a preemptive conservation strategy for carnivores potentially at risk."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe importance of transient dynamics of structured populations is increasingly recognized in ecology, yet these implications are not largely considered in conservation practices. We investigate transient and long-term population dynamics to demonstrate the process and utility of incorporating transient dynamics into conservation research and to better understand the population management of slow life-history species; these species can be theoretically highly sensitive to short- and long-term transient effects. We are specifically interested in the effects of anthropogenic removal of individuals from populations, such as caused by harvest, poaching, translocation, or incidental take. We use the sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) as an exemplar species; it is long-lived, has low reproduction, late maturity, and multiple populations are subject to sport harvest. We found sandhill cranes to have extremely high potential, but low likelihood for transient dynamics, even when the population is being harvested. The typically low population growth rate of slow life-history species appears to buffer against many perturbations causing large transient effects. Transient dynamics will dominate population trajectories of these species when stage structures are highly biased towards the younger and non-reproducing individuals, a situation that may be rare in established populations of long-lived animals. However, short-term transient population growth can be highly sensitive to vital rates that are relatively insensitive under equilibrium, suggesting that stage structure should be known if perturbation analysis is used to identify effective conservation strategies. For populations of slow life-history species that are not prone to large perturbations to their most productive individuals, population growth may be approximated by equilibrium dynamics."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRaptor and corvid electrocutions cause continental conservation concerns for breeding, migrating, and wintering birds. Although concerns are widespread, mitigation is implemented primarily at local scales of individual electric utilities. By not considering landscape-scale patterns, conservation strategies may fail to focus mitigation where efforts are needed most. To enable resource managers to consider electrocution risk at larger scales, we developed a regional model of distribution power pole (pole) density in a grid of 1-km2 cells throughout Colorado and Wyoming. To do so, we obtained data on pole locations from a sample of electric utilities covering 31% of Colorado and Wyoming, and developed a predictive model of poles throughout the remainder of the 2 states. Pole density was influenced by road lengths, number of oil and gas wells, slope, development, and land cover. Poles were densest in areas with high road lengths, high numbers of wells, and relatively flat terrain, and in areas developed for agriculture or human residences. When model predictions are viewed together with species-specific habitat maps, locations where high pole densities overlap habitat suggest areas where mitigating electrocution risk could be prioritized. Communication between resource managers and local utilities could then clarify the poles that caused the highest risk to raptors from electrocution. Thus, the model provides a framework for systematic spatial prioritization in support of regional conservation planning to minimize electrocution of raptors and corvids. © 2016 The Wildlife Society."

    "text": "Abstract\nPrediction is fundamental to scientific enquiry and application; however, ecologists tend to favour explanatory modelling. We discuss a predictive modelling framework to evaluate ecological hypotheses and to explore novel/unobserved environmental scenarios to assist conservation and management decision-makers. We apply this framework to develop an optimal predictive model for juvenile (&lt;1 year old) sandhill crane Grus canadensis recruitment of the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP). We consider spatial climate predictors motivated by hypotheses of how drought across multiple time-scales and spring/summer weather affects recruitment.\nOur predictive modelling framework focuses on developing a single model that includes all relevant predictor variables, regardless of collinearity. This model is then optimized for prediction by controlling model complexity using a data-driven approach that marginalizes or removes irrelevant predictors from the model. Specifically, we highlight two approaches of statistical regularization, Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and ridge regression.\nOur optimal predictive Bayesian LASSO and ridge regression models were similar and on average 37% superior in predictive accuracy to an explanatory modelling approach. Our predictive models confirmed a priori hypotheses that drought and cold summers negatively affect juvenile recruitment in the RMP. The effects of long-term drought can be alleviated by short-term wet spring–summer months; however, the alleviation of long-term drought has a much greater positive effect on juvenile recruitment. The number of freezing days and snowpack during the summer months can also negatively affect recruitment, while spring snowpack has a positive effect.\nBreeding habitat, mediated through climate, is a limiting factor on population growth of sandhill cranes in the RMP, which could become more limiting with a changing climate (i.e. increased drought). These effects are likely not unique to cranes. The alteration of hydrological patterns and water levels by drought may impact many migratory, wetland nesting birds in the Rocky Mountains and beyond. Generalizable predictive models (trained by out-of-sample fit and based on ecological hypotheses) are needed by conservation and management decision-makers. Statistical regularization improves predictions and provides a general framework for fitting models with a large number of predictors, even those with collinearity, to simultaneously identify an optimal predictive model while conducting rigorous Bayesian model selection. Our framework is important for understanding population dynamics under a changing climate and has direct applications for making harvest and habitat management decisions."

    "text": "Abstract\nCarnivores are often sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation, both of which are widespread in Madagascar. Clearing of forests has led to a dramatic increase in highly disturbed, open vegetation communities dominated by humans. In Madagascar’s increasingly disturbed landscape, long-term persistence of native carnivores may be tied to their ability to occupy or traverse these disturbed areas. However, how Malagasy carnivores are distributed in this landscape and how they interact with humans are unknown, as past research has concentrated on populations within continuous and fragmented forests. We investigated local ecological knowledge of carnivores using semi-structured interviews in communities 0 to 20 km from the western edge of continuous rainforest in central-southeastern Madagascar. Responses from 182 interviews in 17 different communities indicated distinct distribution patterns for two native and two exotic carnivore species, suggesting a range of tolerances to the human-dominated landscape. The largest extant native carnivore, the fossa Cryptoprocta ferox, does not persist in much of this landscape; they were only observed in communities &lt; 5 km from the continuous forest within the last five years. In contrast, the ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans was observed by most communities (82%), but was observed by a higher proportion of interviewees from communities in close proximity to continuous forest. The exotic small Indian civet Viverricula indica was ubiquitous, while the exotic/feral cat (Felis sp.) was observed by a higher proportion of interviewees in communities farther from continuous forest. Over 20% of interviewees had experienced loss of poultry to wild carnivores in the last year and negative perceptions of carnivores were common. We found the human-dominated landscape to provide little conservation value to native carnivores, emphasizing the need for adequate protected areas and increased engagement of local communities to sustain Madagascar’s carnivore species. This information is critical to multitaxon conservation planning in Madagascar."

    "text": "Abstract\nMadagascar’s Eupleridae carnivores are perhaps the least studied and most threatened family of Carnivora. Investigating potential direct and indirect competition among these native species and sympatric exotic carnivores is necessary to better direct conservation actions. From 2008 to 2013, we photographically surveyed a diverse rainforest landscape, comparing six native and three exotic carnivores’ activity patterns throughout the diel cycle. We used hierarchical Bayesian Poisson analysis to describe the activity patterns of Madagascar’s carnivore community, assessed effects of season and site on temporal activity patterns, and estimated coefficients of overlap between carnivore pairings to assess effects of body size and ecological niche on temporal overlap among native and exotic carnivores. We observed changes in temporal activity patterns across seasons particularly during the austral summer (hot–dry season) for four native and two exotic carnivores, including evidence of fossa Cryptoprocta ferox altering their temporal activity during their mating season (hot–dry season). We found evidence of high overlap between natives and exotics indicating the potential for increased interactions and competition. The greatest overlap in temporal activity occurred between both ring-tail Galidia elegans and brown-tail vontsira Salanoia concolor and exotic dogs Canis familiaris. Cr. ferox, falanouc Eupleres goudotii and spotted fanaloka Fossa fossana also overlapped in activity with the nocturnal, exotic Indian civet Viverricula indica. Cr. ferox avoided humans and Ca. familiaris across all seasons. Unexpectedly, carnivore body size and ecological niche were not important predictors of temporal overlap. Previous research has shown these native and exotic carnivores overlap spatially and these new findings of temporal overlap among native and exotic carnivores add urgency to the need to manage exotic carnivores across Madagascar."

    "text": "Abstract\nMouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an exciting new primate model for understanding human aging and disease. In captivity, Microcebus murinus develops human-like ailments of old age after five years (e.g., neurodegeneration analogous to Alzheimer’s disease) but can live beyond 12 years. It is believed that wild Microcebus follow a similar pattern of senescence observed in captive animals, but that predation limits their lifespan to four years, thus preventing observance of these diseases in the wild. Testing whether this assumption is true is informative about both Microcebus natural history and environmental influences on senescence, leading to interpretation of findings for models of human aging. Additionally, the study of Microcebus longevity provides an opportunity to better understand mechanisms of sex-biased longevity. Longevity is often shorter in males of species with high male-male competition, such as Microcebus, but mouse lemurs are sexually monomorphic, suggesting similar lifespans. We collected individual-based observations of wild brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) from 2003–2010 to investigate sex-differences in survival and longevity. Fecal testosterone was measured as a potential mechanism of sex-based differences in survival. We used a combination of high-resolution tooth wear techniques, mark-recapture, and hormone enzyme immunoassays. We found no dental or physical signs of senescence in M. rufus as old as eight years (N = 189, ages 1–8, mean = 2.59±1.63 SE), three years older than captive, senescent congeners (M. murinus). Unlike other polygynandrous vertebrates, we found no sex difference in age-dependent survival, nor sex or age differences in testosterone levels. While elevated male testosterone levels have been implicated in shorter lifespans in several species, this is one of the first studies to show equivalent testosterone levels accompanying equivalent lifespans. Future research on captive aged individuals can determine if senescence is partially a condition of their captive environment, and studies controlling for various environmental factors will further our understanding of senescence."

We discuss photographic sampling and occupancy modeling to correct for imperfect detection when estimating system states and dynamics at the landscape level, specifically in relation to primate ecology. We highlight the flexibility of the occupancy framework and its many applications to studying low-density primate populations or species that are difficult to detect. We discuss relevant sampling and estimation procedures with special attention to data collection via photographic sampling. To provide tangible meaning to terminology and clarify subtleties, we use illustrative examples. Photographic sampling can have many advantages over observer-based sampling, especially when studying rare or elusive species. Combining photographic sampling with an occupancy framework allows inference to larger scales than is common in primate studies, addresses uncertainty due to the observation process, and allows researchers to examine questions of how landscape-level anthropogenic changes affect primate distributions."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nMotion-activated cameras are a versatile tool that wildlife biologists can use for sampling wild animal populations to estimate species occurrence. Occupancy modelling provides a flexible framework for the analysis of these data; explicitly recognizing that given a species occupies an area the probability of detecting it is often less than one. Despite the number of studies using camera data in an occupancy framework, there is only limited guidance from the scientific literature about survey design trade-offs when using motion-activated cameras. A fuller understanding of these trade-offs will allow researchers to maximise available resources and determine whether the objectives of a monitoring program or research study are achievable. We use an empirical dataset collected from 40 cameras deployed across 160 km2 of the Western Slope of Colorado, USA to explore how survey effort (number of cameras deployed and the length of sampling period) affects the accuracy and precision (i.e., error) of the occupancy estimate for ten mammal and three virtual species. We do this using a simulation approach where species occupancy and detection parameters were informed by empirical data from motion-activated cameras. A total of 54 survey designs were considered by varying combinations of sites (10–120 cameras) and occasions (20–120 survey days). Our findings demonstrate that increasing total sampling effort generally decreases error associated with the occupancy estimate, but changing the number of sites or sampling duration can have very different results, depending on whether a species is spatially common or rare (occupancy = ψ) and easy or hard to detect when available (detection probability = p). For rare species with a low probability of detection (i.e., raccoon and spotted skunk) the required survey effort includes maximizing the number of sites and the number of survey days, often to a level that may be logistically unrealistic for many studies. For common species with low detection (i.e., bobcat and coyote) the most efficient sampling approach was to increase the number of occasions (survey days). However, for common species that are moderately detectable (i.e., cottontail rabbit and mule deer), occupancy could reliably be estimated with comparatively low numbers of cameras over a short sampling period. We provide general guidelines for reliably estimating occupancy across a range of terrestrial species (rare to common: ψ = 0.175–0.970, and low to moderate detectability: p = 0.003–0.200) using motion-activated cameras. Wildlife researchers/managers with limited knowledge of the relative abundance and likelihood of detection of a particular species can apply these guidelines regardless of location. We emphasize the importance of prior biological knowledge, defined objectives and detailed planning (e.g., simulating different study-design scenarios) for designing effective monitoring programs and research studies."

    "text": "Abstract\nAbundance and density of wild animals are important ecological metrics. However, estimating either is fraught with challenges; spatial capture–recapture (SCR) models are a relatively new class of models that attempt to ameliorate common challenges, providing a statistically coherent framework to estimate abundance and density. SCR models are increasingly being used in ecological and conservation studies of mammals worldwide, but have received little testing with empirical field data. We use data collected via a web and grid sampling design to evaluate the basic SCR model where small-mammal abundance (N) and density (D) are known (via exhaustive sampling). We fit the basic SCR model with and without a behavioral effect to 11 small-mammal populations for each sampling design using a Bayesian and likelihood SCR modeling approach. We compare SCR and ad hoc density estimators using frequentist performance measures. We found Bayesian and likelihood SCR estimates of density (D̂) and abundance (N̂) to be similar. We also found SCR models to have moderately poor frequentist coverage of D and N (45–73%), high deviation from truth (i.e., accuracy; D̂, 17–29%; N̂, 16–29%), and consistent negative bias across inferential paradigms, sampling designs, and models. With the trapping grid data, the basic SCR model generally performed more poorly than the best ad hoc estimator (behavior CR super-population estimate divided by the full mean maximum distance moved estimate of the effective trapping area), whereas with the trapping web data, the best-performing SCR model (null) was comparable to the best distance model. Relatively poor frequentist SCR coverage resulted from higher precision (SCR coefficients of variation [CVs] &lt; ad hoc CVs); however D̂ and D were fairly well correlated (r2 range of 0.77–0.96). SCR’s negative relative bias (i.e., average underestimation of the true density) suggests additional heterogeneity in detection and/or that small mammals maintained asymmetric home ranges. We suggest caution in the use of the basic SCR model when trapping animals in a sampling grid and more generally when small sample sizes necessitate the spatial scale parameter (σ) apply to all individuals. When possible, researchers should consider variation in detection and incorporate individual biological and/or ecological variation at the trap level when modeling σ."

    "text": "Abstract\nConservation and management agencies require accurate and precise estimates of abundance when considering the status of a species and the need for directed actions. Due to the proliferation of remote sampling cameras, there has been an increase in capture–recapture studies that estimate the abundance of rare and/or elusive species using closed capture–recapture estimators (C–R). However, data from these studies often do not meet necessary statistical assumptions. Common attributes of these data are (1) infrequent detections, (2) a small number of individuals detected, (3) long survey durations, and (4) variability in detection among individuals. We believe there is a need for guidance when analyzing this type of sparse data. We highlight statistical limitations of closed C–R estimators when data are sparse and suggest an alternative approach over the conventional use of the Jackknife estimator. Our approach aims to maximize the probability individuals are detected at least once over the entire sampling period, thus making the modeling of variability in the detection process irrelevant, estimating abundance accurately and precisely. We use simulations to demonstrate when using the unconditional-likelihood M0 (constant detection probability) closed C–R estimator with profile-likelihood confidence intervals provides reliable results even when detection varies by individual. If each individual in the population is detected on average of at least 2.5 times, abundance estimates are accurate and precise. When studies sample the same species at multiple areas or at the same area over time, we suggest sharing detection information across datasets to increase precision when estimating abundance. The approach suggested here should be useful for monitoring small populations of species that are difficult to detect."

Risks may be mitigated through marking lines with high-visibility devices, but the effectiveness of line marking remains unclear. Effectiveness is particularly poorly described for lines bisecting open water, where detection of carcasses can be difficult. We marked 3 of 9 spans (lines between adjacent structures) along a causeway crossing open water and 2 adjacent spans over lake shores between Lake Sakakawea and Lake Audubon near Audubon National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota, USA. Over 3 years, we found 1,186 avian carcasses, including 276 attributed to power-line collision. American coots (Fulica americana; n = 83) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus; n = 27) were the species most commonly associated with power-line collision, but we also found carcasses of 51 other species, including a piping plover (Charadrius melodus; n = 1). Multi-variable modeling indicated line marking over open water reduced predicted collisions per span per season (mid-April through mid-October, 2006–2008) from 10.3 to 5.8. Birds with high-aspect-ratio wings benefitted most from line marking (e.g., shorebirds and gulls). If the 9 open-water spans we studied were unmarked for 30 years, we predicted 2,775 collisions. We predicted only 1,560 collisions if all of these spans were marked. Our data demonstrate that a wide variety of avian species are at risk of collision with lines bisecting open water, marking lines can reduce collision risk, and because collisions persisted and some line markers fell off power lines, improvements to effectively mark lines are needed. © 2013 The Wildlife Society."

    "text": "Abstract\nSexually selected traits and the use of strategies to enhance male reproductive success (e.g., competition and dispersal) can yield sex differences in metabolic requirements, rates and durations of growth and maturation, and the propensity for risky behavior, which are suggested to result in age-specific sex differences in mortality and life span. We investigated age-specific sex ratios, mortality, and dispersal in Propithecus edwardsi in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We predicted that, due to similarities in growth rates and body sizes, male and female juvenile mortality rates would be comparable; because both sexes disperse and have intense intersexual competition and aggression, adult mortality would be similar; given similarities in dispersal frequency and distance, the timing of dispersal would not differ. We used 80 group-years births, deaths, and dispersals (Nfemales = 41, Nmales = 34) collected over 23 years to calculate sex ratios and survival curves. Females lived longer than males (maximum 32 and 19 years, respectively). Sex ratios were male biased from sexual maturity through 17 years and female biased at birth and older ages. Infant survival probabilities were similar. Thus, differential development and maturation are unlikely explanations for longer female life span in this species. Males were more likely to survive from 2 to 18 years. However, male annual survival probability declined quickly around 13–18 years; males continued to disperse until their deaths, whereas females generally stopped dispersing after 11 years. We suggest that sex differences in the timing of dispersal and the unique challenges of risky behavior at older ages may be sufficient to yield differences in male and female life span."

    "text": "Abstract\nForest carnivores are threatened globally by logging and forest fragmentation yet we know relatively little about how such change affects predator populations. This is especially true in Madagascar, where carnivores have not been extensively studied. To understand better the effects of logging and fragmentation on Malagasy carnivores we evaluated species composition, density of fossa Cryptoprocta ferox and Malagasy civet Fossa fossana, and carnivore occupancy in central-eastern Madagascar. We photographically-sampled carnivores in two contiguous (primary and selectively-logged) and two fragmented rainforests (fragments &lt;2.5 and &gt;15 km from intact forest). Species composition varied, with more native carnivores in the contiguous than fragmented rainforests. F. fossana was absent from fragmented rainforests and at a lower density in selectively-logged than in primary rainforest (mean 1.38±SE 0.22 and 3.19±SE 0.55 individuals km−2, respectively). C. ferox was detected in fragments &lt;2.5 km from forest and had similar densities in primary and selectively-logged forests (0.12±SE 0.05 and 0.09±SE 0.04 adults km−2, respectively) but was absent in fragments &gt;15 km from forest. We identified only two protected areas in Madagascar that may maintain &gt;300 adult C. ferox. Occupancy of broad-striped mongoose Galidictis fasciata was positively related to fragment size whereas occupancy of ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans elegans was negatively associated with increasing exotic wild cat (Felis spp.) activity at a camera site. Degraded rainforest fragments are difficult environments for Malagasy carnivores to occupy; there is a need to prioritize the reconnection and maintenance of contiguous forest tracts."

    "text": "Abstract\nTemporal partitioning of activity among sympatric species can be an important mechanism for species coexistence. Further, if exotic and native species overlap temporally, there is potential for direct competition and antagonism, which may lead to native species extirpation. We 1st assessed if ecologically similar native carnivores of Madagascar demonstrated activity pattern overlap and then explored whether overlap in activity might lead to negative impacts of exotic carnivores on native carnivores. We used photographic sampling to quantify the temporal activity patterns of carnivores at 4 study sites. The activity of the 2 smaller-bodied native species, Galidia elegans and Galidictis fasciata, overlapped minimally; these 2 carnivores share a similar generalist diet, which may drive their divergent temporal activity. In contrast, the medium-sized native species, Fossa fossana and Eupleres goudotii, were both highly nocturnal; these 2 species appear segregated in their diets. The largest native carnivore, Cryptoprocta ferox, selectively used crepuscular hours, but overall was cathemeral; it was notably absent or basically so at sites where dogs were most abundant and active throughout the diel cycle. We found G. elegans to shift from preferred activity periods in the presence of dogs and the exotic Viverricula indica. Our results suggest that the presence and activity of exotic carnivores can negatively impact native carnivores in fragmented rain forests."

    "text": "Abstract\nPrimates often live in human-altered habitats; Malagasy lemurs are no exception. It is important to understand if habitat alteration affects primates’ space use patterns across multiple spatial and temporal scales, as this drives population density. We quantified the daily, seasonal, and annual space-use of seven groups of Milne-Edwards’ sifaka (Propithecus edwardsi) living in unlogged and logged rain forest in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar between December 2002 and November 2003. Concurrent data showed that sifakas consumed higher quality foods in the unlogged than in logged forests; thus we explored how space use patterns were related to energy use strategies. Sifaka groups in the logged rain forest traveled 7–13% less per day than groups in the unlogged rain forest, despite their larger home ranges (median: 46.12 and 23.52 ha, in the logged and unlogged forests, respectively). Sifakas may thus use an energy-minimizing strategy at the scale of the individual day but an energy-maximizing strategy at the annual home range scale. Sifakas exhibited fidelity to the home range across seasons, but their core area of use shifted considerably with season. We found no difference in population density between sites. However, given the interannual variability in sifaka foods, a multiyear study is needed to assess if energy strategies observed in this study are consistent across longer time periods. Our findings suggest that lemurs may persist in logged habitats by altering spatial use patterns; future work should attempt to quantify the threshold level of forest regeneration from logging that will allow lemurs to persist at similar densities as in unlogged forest."

Red Knots (Calidris canutus) refueling on Horseshoe Crab (Limulus polyphemus) eggs in Delaware Bay can meet their energy needs foraging only by day. In nearby Virginia, thousands of Red Knots stop over, but primarily low-quality, hard-shelled prey are available. One tactic Red Knots may use to meet their energy demands with such prey might be to extend their foraging time by feeding at night. To estimate the length of the foraging day in Virginia, daylight feeding was studied during three spring stopover periods (2008 to 2010), and night feeding was studied in 2010. Red Knots foraged 76 ± 3 SE% of the time in 2008 and 2009 combined, and 59 ± 3% of the time in 2010, during 3-minute observations. In 2010, Red Knots foraged 51 ± 7% of the time during a continuous 7-h daytime observation and 77 ± 5% of the time during a continuous 8-h night time observation on the same island. Given constraints on energy intake, night foraging by Red Knots in Virginia may be necessary for birds to attain sufficient mass to complete migration."

    "text": "Abstract\nEstimating density of elusive carnivores with capture–recapture analyses is increasingly common. However, providing unbiased and precise estimates is still a challenge due to uncertainties arising from the use of (1) bait or lure to attract animals to the detection device and (2) ad hoc boundary-strip methods to compensate for edge effects in area estimation. We used photographic-sampling data of the Malagasy civet Fossa fossana collected with and without lure to assess the effects of lure and to compare the use of four density estimators which varied in methods of area estimation. The use of lure did not affect permanent immigration or emigration, abundance and density estimation, maximum movement distances, or temporal activity patterns of Malagasy civets, but did provide more precise population estimates by increasing the number of recaptures. The spatially-explicit capture–recapture (SECR) model density estimates ±SE were the least precise as they incorporate spatial variation, but consistent with each other (Maximum likelihood-SECR = 1.38 ± 0.18, Bayesian-SECR = 1.24 ± 0.17 civets/km2), whereas estimates relying on boundary-strip methods to estimate effective trapping area did not incorporate spatial variation, varied greatly and were generally larger than SECR model estimates. Estimating carnivore density with ad hoc boundary-strip methods can lead to overestimation and/or increased uncertainty as they do not incorporate spatial variation. This may lead to inaction or poor management decisions which may jeopardize at-risk populations. In contrast, SECR models free researchers from making subjective decisions associated with boundary-strip methods and they estimate density directly, providing more comparable and valuable population estimates."

We therefore deployed 43 camera-trap stations in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar during June–August 2007 to evaluate the efficacy of this method for studying Malagasy carnivores and to estimate the relative abundance and density of carnivores in the eastern rainforest. A total of 755 camera-trap nights provided 1,605 photographs of four endemic carnivore species (fossa Cryptoprocta ferox, Malagasy civet Fossa fossana, ring-tailed mongoose Galidia elegans and broad-striped mongoose Galidictus fasciata), the exotic Indian civet Viverricula indica and the domestic dog Canis familiaris. We identified 38 individual F. fossana and 10 individual C. ferox. We estimated density using both capture-recapture analyses, with a buffer of full mean-maximum-distance-moved, and a spatially-explicit maximum-likelihood method (F. fossana: 3.03 and 2.23 km-2, respectively; C. ferox: 0.15 and 0.17 km-2, respectively). Our estimated densities of C. ferox in rainforest are lower than published estimates for conspecifics in the western dry forests. Within Ranomafana National Park species richness of native carnivores did not vary among trail systems located in secondary, selectively-logged and undisturbed forest. These results provide the first assessment of carnivore population parameters using camera-traps in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar."

The EID chytridiomycosis is a prominent driver of amphibian declines, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). To guide conservation policy, we developed a predictive decision-analytic model that combines empirical knowledge of host-pathogen metapopulation dynamics with expert judgment regarding effects of management actions, to select from potential conservation strategies. We apply our approach to a boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) and Bd system, identifying optimal strategies that balance tradeoffs in maximizing toad population persistence and landscape-level distribution, while considering costs. The most robust strategy is expected to reduce the decline of toad breeding sites from 53% to 21% over 50 years. Our findings are incorporated into management policy to guide conservation planning. Our online modeling application provides a template for managers of other systems challenged by EIDs."

In response to these real or perceived threats from this development, species may adjust their spatial occurrence. Additionally, wildlife species may adjust when in diel time (24-h light–dark cycle) they occupy sites on the landscape to adapt to changing conditions. However, many wildlife studies only focus on where a species does and does not occur, ignoring how species may shift their diel activity at sites to mitigate threats. We used a multi-state diel occupancy modeling framework to investigate how a community of mammals (mesocarnivores, urban-adapted omnivores, and herbivore/small mammals) respond to differing levels of anthropogenic development and forest cover across two climatic seasons. We collected camera trap data at 240 survey locations across the summer and winter of 2021–2022. We modeled multi-state diel occupancy for 14 mammal species with extent of development/forest and season hypothesized to influence diel occupancy and season hypothesized to influence the probability of detection. We found that all species displayed heterogeneity in both diel occupancy and detection either by extent of development/forest and or season. Within the mesocarnivore species group, coyote and red fox were less sensitive to development and had higher occupancy probability at these sites in general but used them more during the night, while more sensitive mesocarnivores including fisher and bobcat occupied the day state only when there was increasing forest cover. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating diel activity in habitat modeling to better understand the relationship between a species and its landscape, particularly in a region that is vulnerable to increased anthropogenic pressure."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nHow animals use the diel period (24-h light–dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g. diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes.\nWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypothesis sets (maximizing, traditional, general and selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime and night-time).\nWe develop a Bayesian modelling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available.\nWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10–1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modelling framework complements other analyses, such as circular kernel density estimators and animal movement modelling.\nOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe social system of animals involves a complex interplay between physiology, natural history, and the environment. Long relied upon discrete categorizations of “social” and “solitary” inhibit our capacity to understand species and their interactions with the world around them. Here, we use a globally distributed camera trapping dataset to test the drivers of aggregating into groups in a species complex (martens and relatives, family Mustelidae, Order Carnivora) assumed to be obligately solitary. We use a simple quantification, the probability of being detected in a group, that was applied across our globally derived camera trap dataset. Using a series of binomial generalized mixed-effects models applied to a dataset of 16,483 independent detections across 17 countries on four continents we test explicit hypotheses about potential drivers of group formation. We observe a wide range of probabilities of being detected in groups within the solitary model system, with the probability of aggregating in groups varying by more than an order of magnitude. We demonstrate that a species’ context-dependent proclivity toward aggregating in groups is underpinned by a range of resource-related factors, primarily the distribution of resources, with increasing patchiness of resources facilitating group formation, as well as interactions between environmental conditions (resource constancy/winter severity) and physiology (energy storage capabilities). The wide variation in propensities to aggregate with conspecifics observed here highlights how continued failure to recognize complexities in the social behaviors of apparently solitary species limits our understanding not only of the individual species but also the causes and consequences of group formation."

    "text": "Abstract\nSNAPSHOT USA is a multicontributor, long-term camera trap survey designed tosurvey mammals across the United States. Participants are recruited through com-munity networks and directly through a website application (https://www.snapshot-usa.org/). The growing Snapshot dataset is useful, for example, for track-ing wildlife population responses to land use, land cover, and climate changesacross spatial and temporal scales. Here we present the SNAPSHOT USA 2021dataset, the third national camera trap survey across the US. Data were collectedacross 109 camera trap arrays and included 1711 camera sites. The total effortequaled 71,519 camera trap nights and resulted in 172,507 sequences of animalobservations. Sampling effort varied among camera trap arrays, with a minimumof 126 camera trap nights, a maximum of 3355 nights, a median 546 nights, and amean 656 ± 431 nights. This third dataset comprises 51 camera trap arrays thatwere surveyed during 2019, 2020, and 2021, along with 71 camera trap arrays thatwere surveyed in 2020 and 2021. All raw data and accompanying metadata arestored on Wildlife Insights (https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/), and are publicly avail-able upon acceptance of the data papers. SNAPSHOT USA aims to sample multipleecoregions in the United States with adequate representation of each ecoregionaccording to its relative size.

    "text": "Abstract\nWildlife must adapt to human presence to survive in the Anthropocene, so it is critical to understand species responses to humans in different contexts. We used camera trapping as a lens to view mammal responses to changes in human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across 163 species sampled in 102 projects around the world, changes in the amount and timing of animal activity varied widely. Under higher human activity, mammals were less active in undeveloped areas but unexpectedly more active in developed areas while exhibiting greater nocturnality. Carnivores were most sensitive, showing the strongest decreases in activity and greatest increases in nocturnality. Wildlife managers must consider how habituation and uneven sensitivity across species may cause fundamental differences in human–wildlife interactions along gradients of human influence."

    "text": "Abstract\nHarvested wildlife populations should ideally be monitored to inform harvest policies and decision-making to help achieve management objectives. When the age of harvested individuals can be obtained, these data (i.e., age-at-harvest data) can be used to estimate trends of abundances, demographic rates, and harvest probabilities by the statistical reconstruction of the living population. This approach was developed primarily within the frequentist framework and requires the inclusion of auxiliary data (e.g., radiotelemetry data). We developed a novel Bayesian hierarchical approach allowing the population reconstruction from the definition of the species’ life cycle without auxiliary data. The hierarchical model assumes that individuals are harvested from an open population whose fluctuations result from demographic processes, and the definition of a superpopulation composed of pseudo-individuals from which the harvested population is drawn. We evaluated the ability of our model to estimate abundances, survival, recruitment, and harvest probabilities based on simulations guided by the demographic processes of a long-lived mammal population. We considered model performance across scenarios, including varying age and temporal structures, superpopulation size, and prior information. We showed how prior information selected based on life history characteristics affects the accuracy of estimated parameters. We found that the model estimates accurate demographic parameters and abundances when the age-at-harvest matrix comprises more than two age classes. Furthermore, an increase in demographic information (number of age groups and years) increased the precision of the estimated parameters. We apply our model to a population of harvested (2012–2021) white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a mammalian carnivore, the fisher (Pekania pennanti), from Rhode Island, USA. Our model estimated biologically realistic population size and demographic rates for both species. Our approach provides robustness to track the population abundance of harvested species through time and estimate fundamental demographic parameters. Such results can be used to monitor whether population objectives are being met and whether harvest policy changes are required. Furthermore, this information can be critical for evaluating the effect of harvest on population growth and projecting trajectories of age-structured populations under different harvest scenarios. Therefore, our framework can help to guide management decisions and species conservation."

    "text": "Abstract\nAim The assembly of species into communities and ecoregions is the result of interacting factors that affect plant and animal distribution and abundance at biogeographic scales. Here, we empirically derive ecoregions for mammals to test whether human disturbance has become more important than climate and habitat resources in structuring communities.\nLocation Conterminous United States.\nTime Period 2010–2021.\nMajor Taxa Studied Twenty-five species of mammals.\nMethods We analysed data from 25 mammal species recorded by camera traps at 6645 locations across the conterminous United States in a joint modelling framework to estimate relative abundance of each species. We then used a clustering analysis to describe 8 broad and 16 narrow mammal communities.\nResults Climate was the most important predictor of mammal abundance overall, while human population density and agriculture were less important, with mixed effects across species. Seed production by forests also predicted mammal abundance, especially hard-mast tree species. The mammal community maps are similar to those of plants, with an east–west split driven by different dominant species of deer and squirrels. Communities vary along gradients of temperature in the east and precipitation in the west. Most fine-scale mammal community boundaries aligned with established plant ecoregions and were distinguished by the presence of regional specialists or shifts in relative abundance of widespread species. Maps of potential ecosystem services provided by these communities suggest high herbivory in the Rocky Mountains and eastern forests, high invertebrate predation in the subtropical south and greater predation pressure on large vertebrates in the west.\nMain Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of climate to modern mammals and suggest that climate change will have strong impacts on these communities. Our new empirical approach to recognizing ecoregions has potential to be applied to expanded communities of mammals or other taxa."

Assign questions for us to focus on or come prepared with questions to lead the discussion. Generally focus on things like…\n\nwhat is the statistical model\ndid the authors define it clearly or reference another paper\nthe type of data that is relevant\nhow the sampling was achieved\nthe inference/prediction that was sought\nhow the model was used to answer the fundamental research question\nnuisances of issues of concern in the modeling or sampling\ntry and connect principles/stastistics in the paper to what we have been doing in the class\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Distribution Model (10/8): Libby Mojica, Travis Rainey\nMark Recapture (10/11): Alex Badeaux, Noel Clark, Elke Tukker\nN mixture or Integrated Data Models (10/25): Sarah Gaulke, Sean Ingram\nAnimal Movement (10/29): Jeremy Alder, Becca Windell\nHabitat Selection (11/5): Waverly Davis, Lisa Roerk\nCommunity Modeling (11/12): Cat Adams, Bijoya Paul\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide on whether you will work on a 1) independent research project or 2) develop a short lecture or lab case study on a statistical methodology. Research projects are individual, while a lecture/lab case study can be a team of 2-3 people.\nOnce decided, individually (for a research project) or as a group (case study), email me a one paragraph synopsis of your plan and topic of choice. Please do this by October 25.  I will followup if I have any questions.\n\n\nConduct a quantitative-focused project, such as a statistical analysis of data, or simulation based investigation. If you are unsure of whether your idea fits, come talk with me. If you want to use data from your graduate research, that would be great, but no need to use all of it or for exactly the purpose of your project. Simplifying the data and analysis is good and appropriate.\nObjectives:\n\nWrite a report; this should be turned in December 6 (last day of classes).\nPresent findings in class as an ignite talk; i.e., a 5 minute long presentation with 20 slides and with the slides advancing automatically every 15 seconds. Presentations will be on December 3 and 6.\n\nPrepare a report via R Markdown that generally follows the sections of 1) idea/hypothesis/setup, 2) data explanation, sampling methodology, and modeling, 3) results, and 4) summary/conclusions.\nIn Canvas, please submit the compiled HTML, as well as all other files needed to knit this file.\nThis class is focused on statistical models and model fitting, so make sure to emphasize the specifics of the statistical model that is being used and how it is being fit.\nThis report does not have to be long, but it should be clear and well presented. Part of the grade will be your focus on communicating the data/model/results visually and via clear statistical language.\n\n\n\nObjective:\n\nCreate a lecture, R code lab, or hybrid centered around a quantitative approach relevant to wildlife ecology and conservation.\n\nFor example, 1) develop a lecture on a specific statistical model, 2) a lab walk through implementing the model and important nuances to consider, or 3) some mixture of these.\nAim for the lecture/lab to be around 25-30 minutes. Presentations will be on December 3 and 6. Please submit the final materials on Canvas by December 6 (last day of classes).\nEvaluation will be based on the clarity and organization of the materials presented and the preparedness of the instructors in engaging with the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability Does Not Exist\nPublic Trust in Scientists\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage of R\nPrelude In R\nData Carpentry\nIntro to R\nMany Resources\nOur Coding Club\nSW Carpentry\nDoser et al. Book\nIntro to R for Biologists\nIntroduction to R - tidyverse\nR for Data Science (2e)\nAdvanced R\nIntroduction to the R Language\nIntroduction to R\nAn Introduction to R for Research\nIntroduction to Data Exploration ana Analysis with R\nWorking with Data in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability Playground: Interactive Probability Distributions\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning\nThe Elements of Statistical Learning.

    "text": "Student Experiences and Pedagogical Techniques\nIn-class lectures: Most class periods will include a lecture that will take 1/4 to 1/2 of the course period. Lectures will often incorporate brief instructor-led questions and short discussions.\nIn-class student-led discussions: Small groups (~2 students) will be assigned to co-lead discussions on assigned readings. These discussions will occur prior to any lecture for that class. This will provide students with an opportunity to communicate about the assigned readings content, raise questions for themselves and learn to elicit thoughts and questions from others.\nIn-class labs: Every other class will include a lab. Students will be challenged in class to work individually or in groups to understand, develop and implement code to fit models.\nOut-of-class lab assignments: Students will be encouraged to work together to finish the remainder of the labs that were started in-class.\nOut-of-class reading: Every other class will have an assigned reading.\nOut-of-class discussion board: Students will communicate on an online discussion board posted to Canvas about specific course prompts related to readings and lecture.\nOut-of-class quizzes: Short quizzes on Canvas will be used to gauge student comprehension of assigned reading and provide accountability for out-of-class preparation.\nGroup project: A group project will be used as a final assessment of the student’s integration of knowledge through the application of learned material. A group of 2-3 students will either 1) develop an independent research project (ideally connected to their graduate research topic), or 2) develops a short lecture along with a lab case-study that showcases a statistical application relevant to wildlife ecology and conservation."

Generally focus on things like…\n\nwhat is the statistical model\ndid the authors define it clearly or reference another paper\nthe type of data that is relevant\nhow the sampling was achieved\nthe inference/prediction that was sought\nhow the model was used to answer the fundamental research question\nnuisances of issues of concern in the modeling or sampling\ntry and connect principles/stastistics in the paper to what we have been doing in the class\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Distribution Model (10/8): Libby Mojica, Travis Rainey\nMark Recapture (10/11): Alex Badeaux, Noel Clark, Elke Tukker\nN mixture or Integrated Data Models (10/25): Sarah Gaulke, Sean Ingram\nAnimal Movement (10/29): Jeremy Alder, Becca Windell\nHabitat Selection (11/5): Waverly Davis, Lisa Roerk\nCommunity Modeling (11/12): Cat Adams, Bijoya Paul\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide on whether you will work on a 1) independent research project or 2) develop a short lecture or lab case study on a statistical methodology. Research projects are individual, while a lecture/lab case study can be a team of 2-3 people.\nOnce decided, individually (for a research project) or as a group (case study), email me a one paragraph synopsis of your plan and topic of choice. Please do this by October 25.  I will followup if I have any questions.\n\n\nConduct a quantitative-focused project, such as a statistical analysis of data, or simulation based investigation. If you are unsure of whether your idea fits, come talk with me. If you want to use data from your graduate research, that would be great, but no need to use all of it or for exactly the purpose of your project. Simplifying the data and analysis is good and appropriate.\nObjectives:\n\nWrite a report; this should be turned in December 6 (last day of classes).\nPresent findings in class as an ignite talk; i.e., a 5 minute long presentation with 20 slides and with the slides advancing automatically every 15 seconds. Presentations will be on December 3 and 6.\n\nPrepare a report via R Markdown that generally follows the sections of 1) idea/hypothesis/setup, 2) data explanation, sampling methodology, and modeling, 3) results, and 4) summary/conclusions.\nIn Canvas, please submit the compiled HTML, as well as all other files needed to knit this file.\nThis class is focused on statistical models and model fitting, so make sure to emphasize the specifics of the statistical model that is being used and how it is being fit.\nThis report does not have to be long, but it should be clear and well presented. Part of the grade will be your focus on communicating the data/model/results visually and via clear statistical language.\n\n\n\nObjective:\n\nCreate a lecture, R code lab, or hybrid centered around a quantitative approach relevant to wildlife ecology and conservation.\n\nFor example, 1) develop a lecture on a specific statistical model, 2) a lab walk through implementing the model and important nuances to consider, or 3) some mixture of these.\nAim for the lecture/lab to be around 25-30 minutes. Presentations will be on December 3 and 6. Please submit the final materials on Canvas by December 6 (last day of classes).\nEvaluation will be based on the clarity and organization of the materials presented and the preparedness of the instructors in engaging with the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability Does Not Exist\nPublic Trust in Scientists\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage of R\nPrelude In R\nData Carpentry\nIntro to R\nMany Resources\nOur Coding Club\nSW Carpentry\nDoser et al. Book\nIntro to R for Biologists\nIntroduction to R - tidyverse\nR for Data Science (2e)\nAdvanced R\nIntroduction to the R Language\nIntroduction to R\nAn Introduction to R for Research\nIntroduction to Data Exploration ana Analysis with R\nWorking with Data in R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability Playground: Interactive Probability Distributions\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning\nThe Elements of Statistical Learning.

    "text": "Abstract\nProtected areas (PA) aim to eliminate many of the threats that species face on the greater landscape. In the last three decades, PA’s have expanded considerably; however, quantitative assessments of how well they have mitigated threats to habitat and biodiversity are very limited. Habitat bordering PA’s and the wildlife that use it are threatened by a wide-range of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., edge effects, fragmentation, and introduced predators) and this situation is particularly acute for low-density, poorly studied carnivore communities. From 2010 to 2015, we photographically sampled within (contiguous forest) and bordering (degraded, fragmented forest) a UNESCO World Heritage rainforest PA in Madagascar - Ranomafana National Park (RNP). We investigated the effects of invasive predators, local people presence, and habitat quality on the endemic rainforest carnivore community using static, dynamic, and co-occurrence models. We found native carnivores to be absent or have a low probability of occurrence in degraded forest bordering the PA, while local people and dogs (Canis familiaris) had high occurrence. Madagascar’s largest endemic carnivore, the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the much smaller ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans), occurrence in RNP declined rapidly over six years; their strong co-occurrence with dogs suggests interspecific competition, direct aggression/mortality, or disease as the cause. We highlight the dangers posed to biodiversity, particularly carnivores, from anthropogenic pressures bordering PA’s and present recommendations to address increased human and dog activity, including programs to control dogs and their impact on biodiversity."

    "text": "Abstract\nHuman dimensions research is valuable to managing human-wildlife interactions, especially in urban environments where such interactions are common. Survey data, which commonly contain Likert scales and questions, are useful in this field; however, these data can be difficult to analyze with formal modeling approaches. We demonstrate one approach, based on hierarchical Bayesian ordinal regression, to evaluate human-coyote relationships in Rhode Island, USA. We implemented a survey to collect demographic and sociocultural characteristics of Rhode Island residents and information related to their knowledge of and experiences with coyotes. Our objectives were to assess how these characteristics affected respondents’ valuation of and interactions (sightings and incidents) with coyotes. We analyzed 980 surveys from October to December 2020. We found that respondents who had fear of coyotes or experienced an incident between an owned animal and coyote, had the lowest valuation of coyotes. The same demographic of respondents also reported the highest sightings of and incidents with coyote. These results indicate that fearful residents, in addition to pet and livestock owners, are priority targets for disseminating information or programming about coyotes. Our analyses and findings demonstrate how Bayesian ordinal regression can provide clear and appropriate inference from survey data on how groups of people vary in their relationship with wildlife. These results are important in effectively and efficiently allocating resources towards mitigation, education, and management of human-wildlife interactions."

The relative bias puts these results in proportion to the size of the true population size: 0.01, 0, 0, making it more clear how little bias there is. Some of this is likely Markov error, such that increasing the number of simulations would drive these values even lower. The results are similar for the high deer density scenario, where the absolute bias is -51.88, 22.6, -21.5, and the relative bias is 0, 0, 0.\nLooking at the sampling distributions for low and deer density, we see the range of possible deer population sizes shrink towards the true value as the sample size increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range (min-max) of possible total deer population estimates at the low deer density for sample sizes (10, 20, and 40) are:\n\n\n      10   20   40\nmin  189  236  519\nmax 1794 1510 1345\n\n\nThe same results for the high deer density are:\n\n\n       10    20    40\nmin 14726 16048 16756\nmax 23128 21901 21476\n\n\n\nTo specifically address the objective of this study, I found that the probability (given the assumed true low deer density and random sampling) of obtaining a single sample at the three different sample sizes (10, 20, and 40) to be substantially lower than the desired probability of 0.90.\n\n#Probability of means being within 10% of truth - low deer density\napply(deer.total.abundance1,1,FUN=function(x){\n  low=true.total1-true.total1*0.05\n  upp=true.total1+true.total1*0.05\n  length(which(x&gt;low & x&lt;upp))/length(x)\n})\n\n[1] 0.129 0.176 0.274\n\n\nHigher probabilities were found under the high deer density, but still do not meet the goal of 90%:\n\n\n[1] 0.496 0.703 0.865\n\n\n\nConsidering low and high deer densities, I found that the objective to be highly certain (0.90 probability) that a single estimate of the total population estimate is within 10% of the true value can not be met at sample sizes of 10, 20, and 40. A sample size of 50 may reach the goal at the high deer density, but a much larger sample size will be need if deer densities are low.

As such, detection probability within a block is assumed to be one (this however should be evaluated). I evaluate three sample sizes of 10, 20, and 40 blocks. The objective is to find the sample size that minimizes costs while being highly certain (0.90 probability) that the total population estimate is within 10% of the true value. This study design evaluation is done by using design-based sampling and inference."

    "text": "First, examining the absolute bias of the estimator, we see that for the low deer density there to be low bias across sample sizes (10, 20, 40): 12.85, -1.17, -2.06, respectively. The relative bias puts these results in proportion to the size of the true population size: 0.01, 0, 0, making it more clear how little bias there is. Some of this is likely Markov error, such that increasing the number of simulations would drive these values even lower. The results are similar for the high deer density scenario, where the absolute bias is -51.88, 22.6, -21.5, and the relative bias is 0, 0, 0.\nLooking at the sampling distributions for low and deer density, we see the range of possible deer population sizes shrink towards the true value as the sample size increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range (min-max) of possible total deer population estimates at the low deer density for sample sizes (10, 20, and 40) are:\n\n\n      10   20   40\nmin  189  236  519\nmax 1794 1510 1345\n\n\nThe same results for the high deer density are:\n\n\n       10    20    40\nmin 14726 16048 16756\nmax 23128 21901 21476\n\n\n\nTo specifically address the objective of this study, I found that the probability (given the assumed true low deer density and random sampling) of obtaining a single sample at the three different sample sizes (10, 20, and 40) to be substantially lower than the desired probability of 0.90.\n\n#Probability of means being within 10% of truth - low deer density\napply(deer.total.abundance1,1,FUN=function(x){\n  low=true.total1-true.total1*0.05\n  upp=true.total1+true.total1*0.05\n  length(which(x&gt;low & x&lt;upp))/length(x)\n})\n\n[1] 0.129 0.176 0.274\n\n\nHigher probabilities were found under the high deer density, but still do not meet the goal of 90%:\n\n\n[1] 0.496 0.703 0.865"

    "text": "Objective 1\nLets explore the Bernoulli/Binomial probability mass function (PMF). Imagine doing a tagging study to estimate the survival of sandhill cranes in New Mexico over the winter. We want to use the PMF to connect the ideas of generating data via a probability distribution that is defined by parameters.\nIn this situation, we are interested in simulating samples or observations (or more generally, generate synthetic data) of where cranes either lived (\\(y = 1\\)) or died (y = 0) over our period of interest (winter). If we use the Bernoulli PMF our focus is typically on each i\\(^th\\) crane, while if we are interested in the sum of the number of cranes that lived (\\(\\sum_{i}^n y_i\\)) than we would use the Binomial PMF. Either way, we need to define the parameter associeted with both function, which is the probability of observing a 1 (\\(P(Y=1)\\)), which we will define here as \\(\\theta\\). To make this a useful exercise, we want to decide on \\(\\theta\\) could be in real life.\nRemember, estimation is turning the process around and having data to inform the parameter. Before we do estimation, we want to understand probability functions through simulating/generating synthetic data so we have a better idea of what we are assuming about our empirical data when we use probability functions to estimate parameters. Plus, this process can help us guide our design of future studies.\n\n# Define sandhill crane over winter survival probability (P(Y=1))\n theta = 0.8\n\nThe Bernoulli PMF is useful when thinking about a single event, happening once. Remember, this is a limiting case of the Binomial PMF. We will use the same function, but change the inputs.\nLets observe/generate a single data point where a crane dies (y = 0) or lives (y = 1). In a sense, we are flipping a theoretical coin with probability theta (i.e., \\(P(Y = 1) = \\theta\\)) to observe/sample whether this tagged crane dies or lives.\n\nrbinom(n = 1, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nConsider 10 tagged cranes to get a sample of the number of alive cranes (success’ or 1’s) at the end of the study\n\nrbinom(n = 1, size = 10, prob = theta)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nNow, consider 10 tagged cranes and you want to keep track of each bird and whether they lived or died (not just the sum of the alive ones).\n\n  rbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n\n\nNotice that changing the arguments ‘size’ and ‘n’ either focuses on the individual event of 0 and 1’s (size = 1) or the sum of the 1’s (size &gt; 1). n controls how many of those outputs you would like to have\nWhat if we wanted to generate synthetic data of mortality, rather than survival? Well, we just change our setup. Still assuming survival probability is 0.80, than the equivalent mortality probability would be \\(\\theta = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\\), such the we are saying the probability a crane dies is \\(P(Y = 1) = \\theta = 0.2\\) Now, we can generate data of cranes that have died (1) and that have lived (0).\n\ntheta = 0.2\nrbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n\n\nWhat is rbinom really doing? Well, the code is actually calling a function using the C programming language because it is fast. But, we can understand more simply what the binomial sampling process looks like by using the generic sample function.\nThe code here defines the outcomes of the stochastic process as either a 0 or 1; x is the argument name of the function. We are asking for 10 trials using size. The replace argument is telling the sampler that we are allowing it sample each outcome (0 and 1) more than one time. Lastly, we are defining the \\(P(y = 1)\\) to be 0.80 and the \\(P(y = 0)\\) to be 0.20. This code replicates the same process as the code above: rbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta).\n\nsample(x = c(1,0),\n       size = 10, \n       replace=TRUE,\n       prob = c(0.8,0.2)\n       )\n\n [1] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n\nExercise 1a\nUse your knowledge of the Binomial PMF and investigate the study design trade offs of a tagging study to estimate the survival of sandhill cranes. Consider 3 sample sizes of tagged individuals (N): 100, 250, and 500. Define the survival probability as $\\theta$ = 0.80. For each sample, estimate the probability of survival using the estimator \\(\\sum(y)/N\\), where y is the number of alive cranes at the end of the study and N is the number of total tagged cranes. We will justify this decision at a later point, but logically this should be a good estimator. For each sample size, you want to approximate the sampling distribution of the estimator. Once you have each sampling distribution,\n\ndisplay the three sampling distributions on a single plot\nevaluate estimator bias and relative bias. Is the estimator biased?\nestimate the probability a given sample mean will be within 10% of the true values (theta).\ndetermine the most cost efficient number of tags to use such that there is 0.90 probability that a single sample mean is within 10% of the true value\n\nNote: make sure you use enough replicates such that the sampling distribution appears well approximated (i.e., symmetric).\n\n  n.sim = 5000\n  n = c(100,250,500)\n  theta = 0.8\n  theta.hat=matrix(NA, nrow=n.sim, ncol=length(n))\n\n  theta.hat[,1]=rbinom(n.sim, n[1], theta)/n[1]\n  theta.hat[,2]=rbinom(n.sim, n[2], theta)/n[2]\n  theta.hat[,3]=rbinom(n.sim, n[3], theta)/n[3]\n\n  plot.data = data.frame(theta.hat = c(theta.hat), N = c(rep(\"10\",n.sim),rep(\"100\",n.sim),rep(\"1000\",n.sim)))\n\n\n  ggplot(plot.data,aes(theta.hat,fill=N))+\n     scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"red\",\"blue\",\"green\"))+\n     geom_density(alpha=0.5,binwidth=0.05,position=\"identity\") + \n    theme_bw()\n\nWarning in geom_density(alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 0.05, position = \"identity\"):\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `binwidth`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated bias and relative bias show that the estimator is unbiased.\n\nbias = apply(theta.hat,2,mean)-theta\nbias\n\n[1] -0.0006680 -0.0000856 -0.0001304\n\n\n\nr.bias = (apply(theta.hat,2,mean)-theta)/theta\nr.bias\n\n[1] -0.000835 -0.000107 -0.000163\n\n\nA sample size of 250 tags is the best choice to minimize costs and meet the objective of having a 0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true value of \\(\\theta\\).\n\n  limits.truth=c(theta-theta*0.05,\n                 theta+theta*0.05\n                 )\n  my.func = function(x){length(which(x&gt;=limits.truth[1] & \n                                     x&lt;=limits.truth[2]))/length(x)\n                        }\n  prob.truth = apply(theta.hat, 2,FUN = my.func)\n  data.frame(n = n, prob = prob.truth)\n\n    n   prob\n1 100 0.7322\n2 250 0.9046\n3 500 0.9780\n\n\nExercise 1b\nWhat if we are wrong about the assumed probability of survival? Well, we can evaluate this assumption! Rather than considering a single truth (\\(\\theta = 0.80\\)), we can instead consider a range of true values. This way we can evaluate the robustness of our findings. Meaning, if we find that a sample size of 250 meets our objective (0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true \\(\\theta\\)) across a range of assumed survival probabilities, we are can be confident in our recommendation of tagging 250 cranes. Keep in mind there is a lot of real world factors we have not accounted for yet!\nUsing a sample size of 250, evaluate whether there is at least 0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true \\(\\theta\\) where \\(\\theta\\) varies from 0.80 to 1.0 by increments of 0.05.

    "text": "Objective 2\nThe Poisson PMF is often the distribution used first when considering count data. For example, counts of plants or animals within a given area. Its always a goog choice when needing to consider rates, such as counts per unit effort. Note that we are not going to think about detection probability at this point. Assuming constant detection probability, we can think of these counts as a measure of relative abundance.\nLet’s say we are interested in counts of American Pika in 10x10 m plots throughout boulder fields in the Rocky Mountains. First, we need to define the mean count, defined as \\(\\lambda\\). Then, we need to decide on how many plots to sample (n).\nSample 10 plots, count pika in each, where the true mean is 100.\n\nrpois(n = 10, lambda = 100)\n\n [1]  90  99  91  96 109  98 100 119 110  99\n\n\nSample 10 plots where the mean is 2\n\nrpois(n = 10, lambda = 2)\n\n [1] 3 3 1 0 2 2 1 3 0 2\n\n\nWhen considering the Poisson distribution, notice how few plots have zero pika. In ecological and wildlife sampling, zero counts are common for a variety of reasons. This is one reason people tend to model counts with two components - a Poisson distribution and a zero-inflated part. More about this later.\nOne of the interesting properties of the Poisson PMF is that it can be fully described with only one parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)), which defines the mean and variance as equivalent. This parameter governs the central tendency of the observations and how much it varies.\nLets look at this property by simulating 10000 counts and estimating the mean and variance.\n\n  set.seed(43243)\n  y = rpois(n = 100000, lambda = 10)\n  mean(y)\n\n[1] 10.00741\n\n  var(y)\n\n[1] 10.0551\n\n\nSo, when using the Poisson distribution, we need to consider that the mean and variance will be assumed equal.\nExercise 2\nEvaluate the sampling distribution of the estimator \\(\\sum(y)/N\\), where y are the counts and N is the number of counts. Assuming \\(\\lambda = 100\\), determine how many sample plots are needed such that the probability a sample is within 5% of the mean is at least 95%.

    "text": "Objective 1\nLets explore the Bernoulli/Binomial probability mass function (PMF). Imagine doing a tagging study to estimate the survival of sandhill cranes in New Mexico over the winter. We want to use the PMF to connect the ideas of generating data via a probability distribution that is defined by parameters.\nIn this situation, we are interested in simulating samples or observations (or more generally, generate synthetic data) of where cranes either lived (\\(y = 1\\)) or died (y = 0) over our period of interest (winter). If we use the Bernoulli PMF our focus is typically on each i\\(^th\\) crane, while if we are interested in the sum of the number of cranes that lived (\\(\\sum_{i}^n y_i\\)) than we would use the Binomial PMF. Either way, we need to define the parameter associeted with both function, which is the probability of observing a 1 (\\(P(Y=1)\\)), which we will define here as \\(\\theta\\). To make this a useful exercise, we want to decide on \\(\\theta\\) could be in real life.\nRemember, estimation is turning the process around and having data to inform the parameter. Before we do estimation, we want to understand probability functions through simulating/generating synthetic data so we have a better idea of what we are assuming about our empirical data when we use probability functions to estimate parameters. Plus, this process can help us guide our design of future studies.\n\n# Define sandhill crane over winter survival probability (P(Y=1))\n theta = 0.8\n\nThe Bernoulli PMF is useful when thinking about a single event, happening once. Remember, this is a limiting case of the Binomial PMF. We will use the same function, but change the inputs.\nLets observe/generate a single data point where a crane dies (y = 0) or lives (y = 1). In a sense, we are flipping a theoretical coin with probability theta (i.e., \\(P(Y = 1) = \\theta\\)) to observe/sample whether this tagged crane dies or lives.\n\nrbinom(n = 1, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nConsider 10 tagged cranes to get a sample of the number of alive cranes (success’ or 1’s) at the end of the study\n\nrbinom(n = 1, size = 10, prob = theta)\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nNow, consider 10 tagged cranes and you want to keep track of each bird and whether they lived or died (not just the sum of the alive ones).\n\n  rbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n [1] 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\n\nNotice that changing the arguments ‘size’ and ‘n’ either focuses on the individual event of 0 and 1’s (size = 1) or the sum of the 1’s (size &gt; 1). n controls how many of those outputs you would like to have\nWhat if we wanted to generate synthetic data of mortality, rather than survival? Well, we just change our setup. Still assuming survival probability is 0.80, than the equivalent mortality probability would be \\(\\theta = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20\\), such the we are saying the probability a crane dies is \\(P(Y = 1) = \\theta = 0.2\\) Now, we can generate data of cranes that have died (1) and that have lived (0).\n\ntheta = 0.2\nrbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta)\n\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0\n\n\nWhat is rbinom really doing? Well, the code is actually calling a function using the C programming language because it is fast. But, we can understand more simply what the binomial sampling process looks like by using the generic sample function.\nThe code here defines the outcomes of the stochastic process as either a 0 or 1; x is the argument name of the function. We are asking for 10 trials using size. The replace argument is telling the sampler that we are allowing it sample each outcome (0 and 1) more than one time. Lastly, we are defining the \\(P(y = 1)\\) to be 0.80 and the \\(P(y = 0)\\) to be 0.20. This code replicates the same process as the code above: rbinom(n = 10, size = 1,prob = theta).\n\nsample(x = c(1,0),\n       size = 10, \n       replace=TRUE,\n       prob = c(0.8,0.2)\n       )\n\n [1] 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n\n\nExercise 1a\nUse your knowledge of the Binomial PMF and investigate the study design trade offs of a tagging study to estimate the survival of sandhill cranes. Consider 3 sample sizes of tagged individuals (N): 100, 250, and 500. Define the survival probability as $\\theta$ = 0.80. For each sample, estimate the probability of survival using the estimator \\(\\sum(y)/N\\), where y is the number of alive cranes at the end of the study and N is the number of total tagged cranes. We will justify this decision at a later point, but logically this should be a good estimator. For each sample size, you want to approximate the sampling distribution of the estimator. Once you have each sampling distribution,\n\ndisplay the three sampling distributions on a single plot\nevaluate estimator bias and relative bias. Is the estimator biased?\nestimate the probability a given sample mean will be within 10% of the true values (theta).\ndetermine the most cost efficient number of tags to use such that there is 0.90 probability that a single sample mean is within 10% of the true value\n\nNote: make sure you use enough replicates such that the sampling distribution appears well approximated (i.e., symmetric).\n\n# Simulate data\n\nThe estimated bias and relative bias show that the estimator is unbiased.\n\n# Calculate Bias\n\n\n# Calculate Relative Bias\n\nA sample size of 250 tags is the best choice to minimize costs and meet the objective of having a 0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true value of \\(\\theta\\).\n\n  # Code to estimat probability here.\n\nExercise 1b\nWhat if we are wrong about the assumed probability of survival? Well, we can evaluate this assumption! Rather than considering a single truth (\\(\\theta = 0.80\\)), we can instead consider a range of true values. This way we can evaluate the robustness of our findings. Meaning, if we find that a sample size of 250 meets our objective (0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true \\(\\theta\\)) across a range of assumed survival probabilities, we are can be confident in our recommendation of tagging 250 cranes. Keep in mind there is a lot of real world factors we have not accounted for yet!\nUsing a sample size of 250, evaluate whether there is at least 0.90 probability of being within 10% of the true \\(\\theta\\) where \\(\\theta\\) varies from 0.80 to 1.0 by increments of 0.05. For example, theta = seq(0.7, 1, by = 0.05).\n\nfor each value of \\(\\theta\\), generate the sampling distribution of estimates of \\(\\theta\\) and then calculate the probability of being within 10% of that given values of \\(\\theta\\)\n\nplot these probabilities on a x-y line graph where the x axis is the true value (\\(\\theta\\)) and the y-axis is the estimated probabilities of interest\nusing the plot, decide whether the findings are robust to the choice of \\(\\theta\\)\n\n\n\n# Simulation and plotting code here\n\nWe see that our objective (green horizontal line) is met or is higher at all values of \\(\\theta\\) ranging from 0.80 to 1.0."

    "text": "Objective 2\nThe Poisson PMF is often the distribution used first when considering count data. For example, counts of plants or animals within a given area. Its always a goog choice when needing to consider rates, such as counts per unit effort. Note that we are not going to think about detection probability at this point. Assuming constant detection probability, we can think of these counts as a measure of relative abundance.\nLet’s say we are interested in counts of American Pika in 10x10 m plots throughout boulder fields in the Rocky Mountains. First, we need to define the mean count, defined as \\(\\lambda\\). Then, we need to decide on how many plots to sample (n).\nSample 10 plots, count pika in each, where the true mean is 100.\n\nrpois(n = 10, lambda = 100)\n\n [1] 127  80  82  89 104  79  98 101 110  83\n\n\nSample 10 plots where the mean is 2\n\nrpois(n = 10, lambda = 2)\n\n [1] 1 3 5 1 2 1 1 2 1 3\n\n\nWhen considering the Poisson distribution, notice how few plots have zero pika. In ecological and wildlife sampling, zero counts are common for a variety of reasons. This is one reason people tend to model counts with two components - a Poisson distribution and a zero-inflated part. More about this later.\nOne of the interesting properties of the Poisson PMF is that it can be fully described with only one parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)), which defines the mean and variance as equivalent. This parameter governs the central tendency of the observations and how much it varies.\nLets look at this property by simulating 10000 counts and estimating the mean and variance.\n\n  set.seed(43243)\n  y = rpois(n = 100000, lambda = 10)\n  mean(y)\n\n[1] 10.00741\n\n  var(y)\n\n[1] 10.0551\n\n\nSo, when using the Poisson distribution, we need to consider that the mean and variance will be assumed equal.\nExercise 2\nEvaluate the sampling distribution of the estimator \\(\\sum(y)/N\\), where y are the counts and N is the number of counts. Assuming \\(\\lambda = 100\\), determine how many sample plots are needed such that the probability a sample is within 5% of the mean is at least 95%. Once this is completed, change to \\(\\lambda  = 25\\). How does your evaluation of the sample size change? Do you need the same, more, or less samples to achieve the same objective?\n\n# Simulation Code\n\n\n# Estimate probability and plot results"

    "text": "Abstract\nShellfish aquaculture is a globally expanding industry, including in urban estuaries that support non-breeding waterfowl. The effects of shellfish aquaculture on the spatial distribution of non-breeding waterfowl, however, are poorly understood and depend on the ecology of waterfowl and cultivated shellfish species. We investigated how proximity to shellfish aquaculture influenced habitat selection and movement patterns of American black ducks (Anas rubripes) during the non-breeding season (~Oct–May) in 2020–2023 in Rhode Island, USA. The extent to which proximity to aquaculture influenced habitat selection of black ducks depended on factors specific to individuals’ primary non-breeding sites, although proximity to aquaculture did not have biologically meaningful influences on black duck movement rates across all sites. Black ducks across sites consistently selected for areas better suited for aquaculture (i.e., areas of potential future development) relative to areas poorly suited for aquaculture (i.e., areas less likely to be developed). The continued expansion of aquaculture into preferred black duck habitats will increase black duck interactions with aquaculture and therefore should be considered in the decision-making process for siting future aquaculture leases. Future studies should quantify the extent to which continued expansion of aquaculture in those preferred coastal habitats directly influences black ducks."

The text should be minimal.\n\n\nI hypothesize that adult African Elephants (Loxodonta africana) increase in weight as they age because they are more efficient at conserving energy and acquiring high quality resources. As such, I predict that older elephants will weigh more than younger adult elephants. Further, I hypothesize that there is a latitudinal effect on the weight of elephants across the continent of Africa because of the extreme drought in the southern part of their range. I predict that elephants further north will weigh more than elephants further south.\nI evaluated these hypotheses by aggregating data on weights of elephants from collaborators. Each individual elephant was weighed in the same manner while being fit with a GPS collar. Each individual had a known age due to longterm demographic monitoring. I derived the mean latitude of each elephants dry season home range.\n\nThis data set consists of three columns. The response variable is weight and the two independent variables are age.years and lat.\n\n  dat = read.csv(\"elephant.study.csv\")\n  head(dat)\n\n    weight age.years        lat\n1 12615.13        41   2.690077\n2 12539.55        50   2.974857\n3 13753.97        21  -4.868759\n4 17269.26        50 -28.437431\n5 16945.27        16 -26.414605\n6 14723.24        39 -11.392111\n\n  par(mfrow=c(3,1))\n    hist(dat$weight)\n    hist(dat$age.years)\n    hist(dat$lat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the data, we see a good frequency of weights ranging from 11681 to 17345. The independent variables are also well distributed and with relatively similar frequency. To make statements of statistical clarity when it comes to rejcting or no rejecting a null hypothesis of no difference, I use a Type I error (\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)).\n\nTo evaluate my hypotheses, I will consider a linear regression model with an additive effect of age.years and lat. I mean centered the variable age.years so that the intercept can be interpreted in relation to the average weight of elephants when at the equator (lat = 0).\n\nmodel = lm(weight~I(age.years-mean(age.years))+lat, data=dat)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ I(age.years - mean(age.years)) + lat, data = dat)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3567.1 -1084.3    44.6   977.9  3467.1 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                Estimate Std.

The effect of age on weight was statistically unclear (p = 0.57), not supporting my hypothesis. The estimated effect was relatively small and negative \\(\\hat{\\beta_{1}} =\\) -8.17, 95% CI = -36.81, 20.47. I found a statistically clear effect of latitude (p = 0) with an estimated effect \\(\\hat{\\beta_{2}} =\\) -79.87, 95% CI = rround(confint(model)[3,],digits=2)`. However, this does not support my hypothesis that elephants would weigh more the further north they lived. Instead, we see that weights decreas with increasing latitude.\n\n\nplot_predictions(model, condition = list(\"age.years\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_predictions(model, condition = list(\"lat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal effect plots show the lack of evidence of the effect of age on weight and the support for decreasing weight with latitude. I suggest that this effect is biologically relevant, given that at the extremes in latitudes, we see that the mean weights of elephants is decreased by 18.125%.\n\nplot_predictions(model, condition = list(\"age.years\",\"lat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe joint prediction plot demonstrates the same findings and the assumption of the additive effect between independent variables.\n\n\nlibrary(ggResidpanel)\nresid_panel(model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top-right plot shows that the residuals are equally spaced below and above zero and that the variation within predicted values are relatively similar. The top-right plot shows no departre of the empirical quantiles of the residuals compared to theoretical values. Lastly, the bottom-right plot shows the residuals look symmetric and roughly Normally-distributed.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(model,4); plot(model,5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the leverage of each observation, there appears to be a few potential outliers (measured by Cook’s distance), but overall there appears to be little concern. However, to evaluate the effect of the three most extreme values, I will drop these observations and then assess whether the interpretation of the results change.\n\n\n                                  Estimate Std.

My interpretation of the results are the same.\n\nI did not find support of either my hypotheses. Rather, I found evidence of a relevant biological effect where the mean weight of elephants decreased with increasing latitude. The total amount of the data that was explained by this model was relatively weak with an \\(R^2 =\\) 0.26`.\nThere are several caveats we need to consider.\n\nSex was not controlled for. Males and female elephants are known to have different mean weights\nThe season of when an elephant was weighed is unknown and thus not controlled for\nI did not consider an interaction between age and latitude\nThe range of ages might have limited our evaluation of the hypothesis. For example, 10 year olds may not be considered adults."

    "text": "Objective: Create a report using Markdown that presents code, results, and summarized findings that uses pilot study data to then inform an evaluation of a study design to monitor Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in the southern Rocky Mountains.\nOverview\nA colleague sampled the occurrence (0 or 1) of Canada lynx at 75 grid cells using camera-traps. They are interested in you helping 1) fit a model to estimate the occurrence probability of lynx and investigate the influence of two variables, and 2) use these estimates to inform future study design scenarios.\n\n\nData and Hypothesis\nA colleague used camera traps to sample whether a lynx was present (1) or assumed absent (0) at each grid cell or ‘site’ (y) during the winter (December to February); we will assume there are no false-positives or false-negatives in these data. They designed the sampling and site selection such they had variation in two important covariates: the distance the camera was from a road (dist.road) and the percentage of forest cover (cover). Their hypothesis is that lynx will avoid human activity by occurring further from roads when they are not under cover, but will occur near roads that are under cover as they are able to remain hidden.\nTo do\nFit the data (lynx.data.csv) using a model that captures the hypothesis of your colleague.\n\ninterpret coefficients\nmake prediction plots\nsummarize results\nStudy Design Evaluation\nYour colleague would like these data to inform them on whether they are sampling enough grid cells/sites. They specifically want to know whether the sample size provides them enough statistical power to be confident that they will reject the null hypothesis of no difference with zero for each of the estimated coefficient at a type I error rate of 0.05. The power they want to achieve is 0.80 probability. Note- in a simulation context - think of getting the sampling distribution of the p-value for each coefficient and evaluating whether the proportion of p-values is below the type I error rate.\nTo do\nUse the estimated coefficients to simulate many data sets (&gt;1000). Fit each data set using the same model as you used to fit the empirical data. Extract the p-value of each coefficient to evaluate whether there is adequate statistical power based on your colleagues desire. If there is not adequate power, consider increasing the sample size.\n\nsimulate many datasets\nfit the same model to each dataset\ncalculate statistical power\nsummarize results and inform your colleague one what they need to know"

    "text": "Objective\nCreate a report using Markdown that presents code, results, and summarized findings that makes inference to the occurence of the Annamite striped rabbit (Nesolagus timminsi) across multiple protected areas in Vietnam.\nBackground\nThis is not real data. However, the basic premise has been adopted from the paper, Getting the big picture: Landscape-scale occupancy patterns of two Annamite endemics among multiple protected areas.\nOverview\nThe Annamite striped rabbit is a forest-dwelling lagomorph that was discovered by science in the mid-1990s. Little is known about this species. What has been done indicates that hunting pressure is a primary driver of its distribution. As such, protected areas are paramount to their conservation. However, protected areas vary in their effectiveness in limiting hunting and some protected areas are founded on multi-use, such that hunting is still allowed.\n\n\nData and Hypothesis\nA camera trap study was conducted in the Annamite mountain range of Vietnam to better understand the distribution of the unique mammal fauna. A central focus was to learn about the effects of anthropogenic activity on the distribution of the Annamite striped rabbit. A total of 50 camera traps were deployed at 5 different protected areas. The cameras were placed systematically with a random starting point to capture variation in the Euclidean distance between a camera and the nearest center of human activity (i.e., village/town). A colleague organized the data, such that for each camera site, the presence (1) or assumed absence (0) of the rabbit was recorded (occur); we will assume there are no false-positives or false-negatives in these data. The main variables of interest are the protected areas (PA) and the distance to human activity (dist.human).\nWorking with your colleagues, they outline their hypothesis that the main driver of rabbit occurrence is hunting within the protected areas. They predict that increasing distance away from human activity will lead to higher rabbit occupancy because people will only travel so far in difficult mountainous terrain. They also hypothesize that this effect will vary by protected area because there is different levels of patrolling and enforcement. But, regardless of protected area, they hypothesize that occurrence at the edge of the protected areas nearest to human activity will be the same because of the similar density of people and that occurrence will be very low.\nTo do\nFit the data (rabbit.occ.data.csv) using a model that captures the hypothesis of your colleague.\n\npresent all parameters with measures of uncertainty\nmake sure to provide evidence whether there is or is not variation of ‘dist.human’ across protected areas\nmake prediction plots that display all relevant variables\nmake a prediction plot for a ‘typical’ protected area; make it clear why this results is important\nsummarize results and offer suggestions for the type of followup study that would be useful"

    "text": "Objective: To understand Bayesian inference and computation.\nBackground\nIn th lecture, we were able to draw samples from the posterior distribution of \\(p\\), the probability of hippo survival, because of the conjugacy of the Binomial likelihood and Beta prior probability distribution of \\(p\\).\nAnother conjugate relationship is between a Poisson likelihood and a Gamma prior probability on \\(\\lambda\\) (the mean of the Poisson).\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\textbf{y} \\sim& \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\\\\n\\lambda \\sim& \\text{Gamma}(\\kappa,\\theta)\n\\end{align*}\n\\] where, the posterior distribution of lambda is\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n[\\lambda|\\textbf{y}] \\sim& \\text{Gamma}(\\kappa^*,\\theta^*).\n\\end{align*}\n\\] #### Data\n\nI am providing two data sets of counts of Brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) with different sample sizes. We know in the sampling area that this primate is rare. This prior knowledge should inform how we specify the prior probability distribution.\nPart 1\nFit a Bayesian model to the two data sets provided, each using two different prior distributions on \\(\\lambda\\).\nFit the model by sampling from the posterior distribution directly. You can do this by using the Wikipedia Conjugate Page to look up the posterior hyperparameters.\nTo decide on your two different prior probability distributions, you need to understand the shape (\\(\\kappa\\)) and scale (\\(\\theta\\)) parameters of the Gamma distribution. I suggest looking at the Gamma distribution wikipedia page, choosing values, and then plotting the distributions. The two prior probability distribution you choose should be a ‘highly informative’ and a ‘low/less informative’ prior distribution. Investigate possible prior probability distributions before looking at the data.\nThe markdown should include\n\nTwo plots of the prior probability distributions\nFour plots of posterior distributions (2 for each data set using each of the two priors).\nA table or list of the posterior means or medians along with 95% credible intervals, as well as a description of what these intervals mean.\nA description of how the different priors influenced the first and second data sets. Did each prior have the same importance with each data set? Why?\nPart 2\nHere, the goal is to replicate the above 4 analyses (2 data sets and 2 priors) using JAGS via the r pacakge ‘rjags’ or Stan via the rpackage ‘rstanarm’.\nFor JAGS, you will need to setup a model.jags file that has the likelihood and prior. Note, that the probability density funcitons in JAGS for Gamma and Poisson are dgamma, and dpois, respectively.\nFor Stan, use the code provided and adapt it based on what you know from the GLM homework.\nThe markdown should include\n\nFour plots of posterior distributions (2 for each data set using each of the two priors).\nA table or list of the posterior means or medians along with 95% credible intervals."

    "text": "Objective\nCreate a report using Markdown that presents code, results, and summarized findings that makes inference to the occurence of the Annamite striped rabbit (Nesolagus timminsi) across multiple protected areas in Vietnam.\nBackground\nThis is not real data. However, the basic premise has been adopted from the paper, Getting the big picture: Landscape-scale occupancy patterns of two Annamite endemics among multiple protected areas.\nOverview\nThe Annamite striped rabbit is a forest-dwelling lagomorph that was discovered by science in the mid-1990s. Little is known about this species. What has been done indicates that hunting pressure is a primary driver of its distribution. As such, protected areas are paramount to their conservation. However, protected areas vary in their effectiveness in limiting hunting and some protected areas are founded on multi-use, such that hunting is still allowed.\n\n\nData and Hypothesis\nA camera trap study was conducted in the Annamite mountain range of Vietnam to better understand the distribution of the unique mammal fauna. A central focus was to learn about the effects of anthropogenic activity on the distribution of the Annamite striped rabbit. A total of 50 camera traps were deployed at 5 different protected areas. The cameras were placed systematically with a random starting point to capture variation in the Euclidean distance between a camera and the nearest center of human activity (i.e., village/town). A colleague organized the data, such that for each camera site, the presence (1) or assumed absence (0) of the rabbit was recorded (occur); we will assume there are no false-positives or false-negatives in these data. The main variables of interest are the protected areas (PA) and the distance to human activity (dist.human) in meters.\nWorking with your colleagues, they outline their hypothesis that the main driver of rabbit occurrence is hunting within the protected areas. However, there is no spatial variable or direct measure of hunting pressure throughout the park. Rather, they predict that increasing distance away from human activity will lead to higher rabbit occupancy because people will only travel so far in difficult mountainous terrain. They also hypothesize that this effect will vary by protected area because there is different levels of patrolling and enforcement. But, regardless of protected area, they hypothesize that occurrence at the edge of the protected areas nearest to human activity will be the same because of the similar density of people and that occurrence will be very low.\n\nTo do\nFit the data (rabbit.occ.data.csv) using a single model that captures the hypothesis of your colleague.\n\nvisualize and summarize the data\npresent all parameters with measures of uncertainty\ndescribe what each parameter means; discuss relevant measures of statistical clarity using hypothesis tests or confidence intervals\nmake sure to provide evidence whether there is or is not variation of ‘dist.human’ across protected areas\nmake prediction plots that display all relevant variables: PA and dist.human\n\nmake a prediction plot for a ‘typical’ protected area; make it clear why this results is important\nsummarize results and offer suggestions for the type of followup study that would be useful\n\n\nVisualize the Data\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndat = read.csv(\"rabbit.occ.data.csv\")\n\n# data structure and attributes\n  str(dat)\n\n'data.frame':   250 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ X         : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ PA        : chr  \"PA1\" \"PA1\" \"PA1\" \"PA1\" ...\n $ camera    : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ occur     : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\n $ dist.human: num  140 188 363 408 504 ...\n\n# frequency of 0's and 1's\n  table(dat$occur)\n\n\n  0   1 \n107 143 \n\n# how many cameras at each protected area\n  table(dat$PA)\n\n\nPA1 PA2 PA3 PA4 PA5 \n 50  50  50  50  50 \n\n# histogram of distance to human activity\n  hist(dat$dist.human)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# histograms of human activity measured across PA's  \nggplot(dat, aes(x=dist.human))+\n  geom_histogram(color=\"black\", fill=\"white\")+\n  facet_grid(PA ~ .)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fitting\nTo evaluate the hypothesis, I fit a hierarchical binomial regression model to the rabbit occurrence data. First, to improve model convergence and maintain the main covariate of interest in terms of an understandable measure of distance, I scaled the dist.human variable by 1000 to obtain distance in kilometers. This also allows the intercept to reflect the logit-value of occurence when dist.human is zero, which is a consideration of the hypothesis.\nThe model includes a fixed effect intercept (i.e., does not very by protected area) and a random effect for scaled distance to human activity (dist.human.sc) by protected area (i.e., the slope does vary by protected area). This model structure captures the types of variation proposed in the hypothesis. I will use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to determine statistical clarity.\n\nlibrary(glmmTMB)\n\n#scale distances to kilometers\ndat$dist.human.sc = dat$dist.human/1000\n\nmodel = glmmTMB(occur~dist.human.sc+(0+dist.human.sc||PA),\n                family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), \n                data=dat\n                )\n\nResults\n\nsummary(model)\n\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula:          occur ~ dist.human.sc + (0 + dist.human.sc || PA)\nData: dat\n\n     AIC      BIC   logLik deviance df.resid \n   268.5    279.1   -131.3    262.5      247 \n\nRandom effects:\n\nConditional model:\n Groups Name          Variance Std.Dev.\n PA     dist.human.sc 0.1118   0.3343  \nNumber of obs: 250, groups:  PA, 5\n\nConditional model:\n              Estimate Std.

As such, across all protected areas (including unsampled areas), a ‘typical’ protected area is expected to have increasing occurrence of the striped rabbit the further from centers of human activity. The prediction that striped rabbit occurrence would be low near human activity is supported with a predicted occurrence of 0.13 (i.e., plogis(-1.9236)) at a distance of zero. We also see that there is support for variation in the effect of dist.human.sc as the standard deviation of the protected area slope differences is well above zero at 0.33 and the 95% confidence intervals do not include zero.\n\nbroom.mixed::tidy(model, effects = \"ran_vals\", conf.int = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 9\n  effect   component group level term      estimate std.error conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ran_vals cond      PA    PA1   dist.hum…  -0.192      0.188  -0.561     0.177 \n2 ran_vals cond      PA    PA2   dist.hum…   0.0409     0.191  -0.334     0.416 \n3 ran_vals cond      PA    PA3   dist.hum…  -0.349      0.189  -0.720     0.0211\n4 ran_vals cond      PA    PA4   dist.hum…   0.533      0.264   0.0159    1.05  \n5 ran_vals cond      PA    PA5   dist.hum…  -0.0941     0.189  -0.465     0.277 \n\n\nLooking at the protected area specific differences from the population-mean (i.e., the random effect values), we see the largest difference of 0.53 for protected area 4, which is statistically clearly different than zero as the 95% confidence intervals do not include 0. No other random effect are statistically clearly different than the population mean. This suggests an increase in power is warranted by sampling more sites at each protected area.\nIf we combine the population mean effect and the differences by protected area, we get the mean slope of dist.human.sc by protected area. We see that all slopes are positive, indicating that there is no evidence that increasing distances reduces rabbit occurence.\n\nfixef(model)[[1]][2]+ranef(model)[[1]]$PA\n\n    dist.human.sc\nPA1     0.7876961\nPA2     1.0206335\nPA3     0.6305017\nPA4     1.5128966\nPA5     0.8857225\n\n\nNext, lets visualize the probability of rabbit occurrence at a typical site.

There is evidence for variation of the effect of distance to human activity on striped rabbit occurence and that as distances increases, occurrence increases. We are measuring a proxy for hunting pressure, but assuming distance relates to human hunting pressure and not other confounding factors, our hypothesis is supported. A follow up study might want to plan for increasing the sampling at each protected area to better test for differences of the main effect by protected area (i.e., increase the statistical power). Second, we may want to consider a random intercept to evaluate the hypothesis that there is variation of rabbit occurrence near human activity."

They are interested in you helping fit a model to estimate the occurrence probability of lynx and evaluate their hypothesis.\n\n\nData and Hypothesis\nA colleague used camera traps to sample whether a lynx was present (1) or assumed absent (0) at each grid cell or ‘site’ (y) during the winter (December to February); we will assume there are no false-positives or false-negatives in these data. They designed the sampling and site selection such they had variation in two important covariates: the Euclidean distance the camera was from the nearest road (dist.road) and the percentage of forest cover (cover) at the site. Their hypothesis is that lynx will avoid human activity by occurring further from roads when they are not under cover, but will occur near roads that are under cover as they are able to remain hidden.\nTo do\nFit the data (lynx.data.csv) using a single model that allows you to evaluate the hypothesis of your colleague.\n\ninterpret coefficients (what they mean exactly)\nmake prediction plot(s)\nsummarize results and evaluate hypothesis support or not\nprovide any nuance in findings that are outside of the core hypothesis\nModeling\nTo represent the hypothesis about the occurrence of Lynx, I fit a binomial regression model with a logit link and an interaction between the two variables of interest (scaled and centered), the Euclidean distance the camera was from a road (dist.road) and the percentage of forest cover (cover).

The intercept represents the occurrence probability on the logit scale (0.5149) at the mean level (i.e., scaled variables = 0) of both variables, which translates to a probability of occurence of 0.62 (i.e. plogis(0.5149)). The effect of dist.road.sc is the conditional effect on the logit-scale when cover.sc is at its mean value (i.e., 0.45, untransformed). The coefficient being positive indicates that when cover is at the mean level, increasing distances from the nearest road leads to increasing probability of lynx occurrence.\nThe effect of cover.sc is the conditional effect on the logit-scale when dist.road.sc is at its mean value (i.e., 962 m, untransformed). The coefficient being positive indicates that when dist.road.sc is at the mean level, increasing cover leads to increasing probability of lynx occurrence. However, this effect was not statistically clearly different zero.\nThe effect of the interaction, dist.road.sc:cover.sc, is how the slopes/coefficients of each conditional effect is modified when both variables are not at the mean value (i.e., 0). Since this effect is statistically clearly different than zero, we know that we can’t understand the occurrence probability of lynx by just knowing cover or just knowing distance to the nearest road. We need both these values, as the slope of one variable changes in the context of the other variable. Since the estimated interaction effect was negative, we know that when either cover or dist.road is below the mean (&lt;0), but not both, occupancy will be higher than the implied probability of the intercept (0.62). However, if both variables are below their means (&lt;0) or above the means (&gt;0) than occupancy will be lower than the implied probability of the intercept. To visualize and fully evaluate the hypothesos, I will plot the predicted occupancy of lynx under both combinations of cover and dist.road.\n\n# Predict the probability of occurence\nmarginaleffects::plot_predictions(model,condition=c(\"dist.road.sc\",\"cover.sc\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that when cover is high (e.g. 1.98 (scaled); purple line; unscaled this value of cover is 0.94), lynx probability of occupancy is near 1 when close to roads, but decreases at increasing distance from the nearest road. Conversely, when cover is low (e.g., -1.7; red line; unscaled this value of cover is 0.03), lynx have low to no occupancy near roads, but high occupancy far from roads.\nConclusion\nThese result supports the hypothesis stated above. There are also some interesting findings that are not represeted in the hypothesis. For example, at medium cover (e.g., 0.77 scaled value) the effect of roads is minimal (blue line). Also, it was unexpected that lynx would not occur with high probability far from roads at high cover. Based on these findings, there seems to be some tradeoff, where far from roads lynx occurence is high at low and medium cover. This may have to do with finding open travel routes and seeking areas of cover for hunting."

    "text": "Abstract\nMuskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) populations have been in apparent decline across their native range in North America for decades. Several hypotheses exist for the causes of these declines, including loss of wetlands. We used time-to-detection data from 925 surveys from 276 sites across Rhode Island, USA, between 2021–2023 to fit an occupancy model that related the probability of muskrat occupancy at a site to land cover classification. We found that muskrat occupancy was higher in areas with more open water, urban land cover, or a second-order or larger stream, and lower in areas with salt water. We estimated changes in wetland area throughout Rhode Island using the National Land Cover Database classifications from 2001 and 2019 and found a net loss in wetland cover of 219 ha. We calculated the distance between wetland patches in each of these periods and found that patches were closer together than the dispersal distance of muskrats, suggesting isolation is unlikely to be driving muskrat declines. Additionally, when we used our model to predict changes in muskrat occupancy between 2001 and 2019, both mean and median predicted occupancy changed by &lt;0.005. These results indicate that muskrat declines are not driven by habitat loss, and suggest future research is needed that focuses on other hypothesized mechanisms of muskrat declines such as disease, declining habitat quality, predation, and competition."

    "text": "Abstract\nAnimals alter their diel activity in response to physiological constraints and ecological conditions. Fisher (Pekania pennanti) activity is known to vary through the diel cycle and change in response to cold stress and generally through both the climatic and biological seasons. However, less is known whether thermoregulatory effects impact fisher activity in milder climates and in areas of high human disturbance. We focused on two distinct research objectives to understand the 1) physiological constraints, and 2) ecological components of fisher activity in a highly disturbed landscape with a relatively mild climate. We used accelerometer data from 34 individual live-captured fisher in Rhode Island, USA from 2021 to 2023. We found that fisher activity patterns were primarily driven by diel cycle with higher activity levels at night than during the day. We did not observe any physiological influence of ambient temperature on fisher activity; daily minimum temperatures did not constrain fisher activity in the colder months, nor did daily maximum temperatures in warmer months. We did find that female activity levels differed by breeding status with non-pregnant females having higher activity levels than pregnant females. Considering ecological components, we found fisher decreased activity levels in higher road density areas during warmer months that coincide with higher traffic volumes. For fisher living in areas with lower road densities, we saw higher activity in the breeding season and summer than in winter. In contrast, fisher living in areas with high road densities had lower activity in the breeding season and summer than in winter. We conclude that fisher largely do not shift their activity to mitigate thermoregulatory costs in areas where temperatures do not reach extremes for extended periods of time. However, our findings suggest that behavioral shifts in activity are impacted by human disturbance and fisher minimize activity in risky areas."

For illustration, we will transform the CRS of tr2 to geographical coordinates (EPSG:4326).\n\ntransform_coords(tr2, 4326)\n\n# A tibble: 1,493 × 5\n      x_    y_ t_                  id       month\n * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 00:01:47 Animal 1     3\n 2  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 06:00:54 Animal 1     3\n 3  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 12:01:47 Animal 1     3\n 4  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:01:24 Animal 1     3\n 5  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:25:56 Animal 1     3\n 6  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:26:05 Animal 1     3\n 7  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:26:14 Animal 1     3\n 8  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:26:24 Animal 1     3\n 9  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:26:33 Animal 1     3\n10  9.89  54.1 2008-03-30 18:38:01 Animal 1     3\n# ℹ 1,483 more rows\n\n\nSome initial data exploration\nSeveral functions for calculating derived quantities are available. We will start with looking at step length. The function step_lengths can be used for this.\n\ntr2 &lt;- tr2 |&gt; mutate(sl_ = step_lengths(tr2))\n\nIf we look at a summary of sl_ we note two things:\n\nsummary(tr2$sl_)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n   0.00   35.01  105.33  249.07  297.75 4727.86       1 \n\n\nNote, 1) there is a NA for the last step length, this is expected because we are still in a point representation (i.e., there is no step length for the last relocation). 2) the range is fairly large ranging from 0 to almost 5 km. Before looking at step lengths in any further detail, we will have to make sure the sampling rate is more or less regular (i.e., the same time step between any two points).\nThe function summarize_sampling_rate provides an easy way to look at the sampling rate.\n\nsummarize_sampling_rate(tr2)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 9\n     min    q1 median  mean    q3   max    sd     n unit \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 0.0025  2.00   2.01  6.34  6.00 3924.  102.  1492 hour \n\n\nThis suggests that a sampling rate for 6 hours might be adequate. We can then use the function track_resample to resample the track and only keep relocations that are approximately 6 hours apart (within some tolerance, that can be specified). We will use the function lubridate::hours to specify the sampling rate and lubridate::minutes to specify the tolerance. Both arguments rate and tolerance are expected to be a Period.\n\ntr3 &lt;- tr2 |&gt; track_resample(rate = hours(6), tolerance = minutes(20))\ntr3\n\n# A tibble: 826 × 7\n        x_      y_ t_                  id       month    sl_ burst_\n *   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 3558528 5999094 2008-03-30 00:01:47 Animal 1     3  41.8       1\n 2 3558513 5999055 2008-03-30 06:00:54 Animal 1     3 104.        1\n 3 3558564 5999146 2008-03-30 12:01:47 Animal 1     3  95.3       1\n 4 3558504 5999072 2008-03-30 18:01:24 Animal 1     3  22.8       1\n 5 3557474 5999130 2008-03-31 00:01:23 Animal 1     3 155.        1\n 6 3557319 5999127 2008-03-31 06:01:45 Animal 1     3   6.08      1\n 7 3557313 5999126 2008-03-31 12:01:11 Animal 1     3   4.47      1\n 8 3557317 5999128 2008-03-31 18:01:55 Animal 1     3 113.        1\n 9 3557204 5999130 2008-04-01 00:01:24 Animal 1     4 187.        1\n10 3557108 5999291 2008-04-01 06:00:54 Animal 1     4   6.32      1\n# ℹ 816 more rows\n\n\ntr3 still a track, but with two differences compared to tr2. 1) the number of rows is reduced from 1493 to 826, because only relocations that are 6 hours +/- the tolerance apart of each other are retained; 2) tr3 has one new column called burst_. A burst is sequence of relocations with equal sampling rates. Consider the following hypothetical example: 5 relocations are all 6 hours apart. Then there is a gap of 12 hours because one relocation failed and afterwards then there are an other 10 relocations all 6 hours apart. Then we would consider the first 5 relocations as a burst and the second 10 relocations (after the 12 hour gap) as a second burst.\nFrom tracks to steps\nIn many situations we are more interested in steps (that is the animal moving from one relocation to an other, or the straight line between a start and a end point), that in the individual relocations. amt supports steps as an other way to represent movement data. The transition from a track to steps can be done via two functions.\n\n\nsteps(): Takes as an input a track, converts the track to step and calculating some derived quantities (e.g., step lengths, turning angles). The function steps() expects a track with regular sampling rates.\n\nsteps_by_burst(): Takes as an input a resampled track (i.e., a track with several bursts) and will calculate derived quantities per burst."

    "text": "How to deal with several animals\nUp to now we have only considered situations with one animal. However, in most telemetry studies more than one animal are tracked and we often want to calculated movement relevant characteristics for several animals individually. amt does not provide a infrastructure for dealing with several animal, however, list-columns from the tidyverse can be used to manage many animals. Because a track is just a tibble all tidyverse verbs can be used. The general strategy consists of three steps:\n\nNest a track by one or more columns. This retains the unique values of the grouping variable(s) and creates a new list-column with tracks.\nNow we can perform operations on the grouped data creating a new list column. This can be done in a combination with mutate and map (instead of map also lapply could be used).\nSelect the relevant columns and unnest. With select() we can select columns of interest and reverse the nesting with the function unnest().\n\nAs an example we will use a second data set included in amt on tracks of four fishers. We will load the data, create a track, resample the tracks individually to 30 min and create a histogram of step lengths (accounting for bursts).\nWe start by loading the data and creating a track of all individuals together\n\ndata(\"amt_fisher\")\ntrk &lt;- amt_fisher |&gt; make_track(x_, y_, t_, id = id)\n\nNext, we group the track by id and nest the track.\n\ntrk1 &lt;- trk |&gt; nest(data = -\"id\")\ntrk1\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  id    data                  \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt;                \n1 M1    &lt;trck_xyt [919 × 3]&gt;  \n2 M4    &lt;trck_xyt [8,958 × 3]&gt;\n3 F2    &lt;trck_xyt [3,004 × 3]&gt;\n4 F1    &lt;trck_xyt [1,349 × 3]&gt;\n\n\nWe now want to resample each track to 30 minutes with a tolerance of 5 minutes and create steps for each animal.

This measure does not rely on a UD and is directional (i.e., \\(HR_{i,j} \\ne HR_{j,i}\\)) and bound between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete overlap)\n\nphr: Is the probability of instance \\(j\\) being located in the home range of instance \\(i\\). phr is also directional and bounded between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (complete overlap)\n\nvi: The volumetric intersection between two UDs.\n\nba: The Bhattacharyya’s affinity between two UDs.\n\nudoi: A UD overlap index.\n\nhd: Hellinger’s distance between two UDs.\n\nThese overlap indices can be calculated with the function hr_overlap. The type of overlap measure an be controlled with the argument type.\nAll of these estimators can be calculated for a given home-range level (i.e., using conditional UDs). Whether or not a conditional overlap is desired or not, can be controlled with the argument conditional. For hr, the argument conditional has no effect and the isopleths used for home-range estimation will always be used for the overlap calculation.\nThe function hr_overlap() can also be provided with a list of home-range estimates in situations when overlap between many different instances are required. Currently, there are three options for calculating overlap among multiple instances: which = \"all\" calculates overlap for each pair of home ranges, which = \"one_to_all\" calculates overlap between the first element in the list and all others, and which = \"consecutive\" will calculate overlap between consecutive elements in the list."

    "text": "Examples\nFirst we need to load the required packages:\n\nlibrary(amt)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidygraph)\nlibrary(ggraph)\n\nTwo instances\nWe will use tracking data from Fishers from New York State, USA.\n\nleroy &lt;- amt_fisher |&gt; filter(name == \"Leroy\")\nlupe &lt;- amt_fisher |&gt; filter(name == \"Lupe\")\n\nCreate a template raster for the KDE\n\ntrast &lt;- make_trast(amt_fisher |&gt; filter(name %in% c(\"Leroy\", \"Lupe\")), res = 50)\n\nAnd estimate home-ranges for both fishers\n\nhr_leroy &lt;- hr_kde(leroy, trast = trast, levels = c(0.5, 0.9))\nhr_lupe &lt;- hr_kde(lupe, trast = trast, levels = c(0.5, 0.9))\n\nhr and phr are directional, this means the order matters. For all other overlap measures the order does not matter.\n\nhr_overlap(hr_leroy, hr_lupe, type = \"hr\") \n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.9   0.309\n2    0.5   0.191\n\nhr_overlap(hr_lupe, hr_leroy, type = \"hr\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.9   0.986\n2    0.5   0.574\n\n\nBy default conditional = FALSE and the full UD is used.\n\nhr_overlap(hr_leroy, hr_lupe, type = \"phr\", conditional = FALSE) \n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1       1\n\nhr_overlap(hr_lupe, hr_leroy, type = \"phr\", conditional = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1   0.736\n\n\nIf we set conditional = TRUE, the overlap is measured at home-range levels that were specified during estimation.\n\nhr_overlap(hr_leroy, hr_lupe, type = \"phr\", conditional = TRUE) \n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.5   0.580\n2    0.9   0.992\n\nhr_overlap(hr_lupe, hr_leroy, type = \"phr\", conditional = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    0.5   0.221\n2    0.9   0.401\n\n\nNote, for the remaining overlap measures the order does not matter. Below we show this for the volumnic intersection (type = \"vi\") as an example.\n\nhr_overlap(hr_lupe, hr_leroy, type = \"vi\", conditional = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1   0.439\n\nhr_overlap(hr_leroy, hr_lupe, type = \"vi\", conditional = FALSE)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  levels overlap\n   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      1   0.439\n\n\n\n\\(&gt; 2\\) instances\nLets calculate daily ranges for Lupe and then and then see how different ranges overlap with each other.\nWe have to use the same template raster in order to make ranges comparable.\n\ntrast &lt;- make_trast(lupe, res = 50)\n\nThen we add a new column with day and calculate for each day a KDE home range.\n\ndat &lt;- lupe |&gt; \n  mutate(week = lubridate::floor_date(t_, \"week\")) |&gt; \n  nest(data = -week) |&gt; \n  mutate(kde = map(data, hr_kde, trast = trast, levels = c(0.5, 0.95, 0.99)))\n\nNow we can use the list column with the home-range estimates to calculate overlap between the different home-ranges. By default which = \"consecutive\", this means for each list entry (= home-range estimate) the overlap to the next entry will be calculated.\n\nhr_overlap(dat$kde, type = \"vi\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n   from    to levels overlap\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     2      1  0.0431\n2     2     3      1  0.551 \n3     3     4      1  0.612 \n\n\nThis works as well, if we set conditional = TRUE:\n\nhr_overlap(dat$kde, type = \"vi\", conditional = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 4\n   from    to levels overlap\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     2   0.5   0     \n2     1     2   0.95  0.0264\n3     1     2   0.99  0.0357\n4     2     3   0.5   0.264 \n5     2     3   0.95  0.528 \n6     2     3   0.99  0.547 \n7     3     4   0.5   0.318 \n8     3     4   0.95  0.592 \n9     3     4   0.99  0.608 \n\n\nSometimes it can be useful to provide meaningful labels. We can do this with the labels argument.\n\nhr_overlap(dat$kde, type = \"vi\", labels = dat$week)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  from       to         levels overlap\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2010-12-12 2010-12-19      1  0.0431\n2 2010-12-19 2010-12-26      1  0.551 \n3 2010-12-26 2011-01-02      1  0.612 \n\n\nDifferent options exist for the argument which. For example, which = \"one_to_all\" calculates the overlap between the first and all other home ranges."

    "text": "The basic building blocks of amt are tracks. Tracks are tibbles with at least two columns that contain the coordinates: x_ and y_. A track behaves exactly like a tibble (the only difference being that we added an other S3 class). Below is an example of creating a track with some dummy locations.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(amt)\ndf1 &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:3)\nis.data.frame(df1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      x     y\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1\n2     2     2\n3     3     3\n\n# Now we can create a track\ntr1 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y)\nis.data.frame(tr1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntr1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n     x_    y_\n* &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1\n2     2     2\n3     3     3\n\n\nAt the moment amt supports two types of tracks:\n\n\ntrack_xy is a track that only has coordinates, and\n\ntrack_xyt is a track that has a timestamp associated to each coordinate pair.\n\nIf a track_xy or track_xyt is created with the function make_track, is determined whether or not a timestamp is passed as a third argument (called .t) to the function make_track. In the previous example we only passed x and y coordinates. Hence a track_xy was created.\n\nclass(tr1)\n\n[1] \"track_xy\"   \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nTo create a track_xyt we could do the following\n\ndf1 &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, t = lubridate::ymd(\"2017-01-01\") + lubridate::days(0:2))\ntr2 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y, t)\nclass(tr2)\n\n[1] \"track_xyt\"  \"track_xy\"   \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nFrom the output above we see that a track_xyt is also a track_xy. This means that all methods for track_xy also work for a track_xyt (but not the reverse).\n\nWe can also add additional information for each relocation (e.g., the id of the animal, or some other sensor information such as the DOP).

    "text": "The basic building blocks of amt are tracks. Tracks are tibbles with at least two columns that contain the coordinates: x_ and y_. A track behaves exactly like a tibble (the only difference being that we added an other S3 class). Below is an example of creating a track with some dummy locations.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(amt)\ndf1 &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:3)\nis.data.frame(df1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ndf1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      x     y\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1\n2     2     2\n3     3     3\n\n# Now we can create a track\ntr1 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y)\nis.data.frame(tr1)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntr1\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n     x_    y_\n* &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1\n2     2     2\n3     3     3\n\n\nAt the moment amt supports two types of tracks:\n\n\ntrack_xy is a track that only has coordinates, and\n\ntrack_xyt is a track that has a timestamp associated to each coordinate pair.\n\nIf a track_xy or track_xyt is created with the function make_track, is determined whether or not a timestamp is passed as a third argument (called .t) to the function make_track. In the previous example we only passed x and y coordinates. Hence a track_xy was created.\n\nclass(tr1)\n\n[1] \"track_xy\"   \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nTo create a track_xyt we could do the following\n\ndf1 &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, t = lubridate::ymd(\"2017-01-01\") + lubridate::days(0:2))\ntr2 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y, t)\nclass(tr2)\n\n[1] \"track_xyt\"  \"track_xy\"   \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nFrom the output above we see that a track_xyt is also a track_xy. This means that all methods for track_xy also work for a track_xyt (but not the reverse).\n\nWe can also add additional information for each relocation (e.g., the id of the animal, or some other sensor information such as the DOP). Any number of additional named columns can be passed to make_track. By named we mean, that columns should always be passed in the form of column_name = content to avoid confusion with coordinates and time stamp. We will extend the dummy example from above, by passing 2 more columns (the id of animal and the age).\n\ndf1 &lt;- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 1:3, t = lubridate::ymd(\"2017-01-01\") + lubridate::days(0:2), \n                  id = 1, age = 4)\n\n# first we only create a track_xy\ntr3 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y, id = id, age = age)\ntr3\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n     x_    y_    id   age\n* &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     1     1     4\n2     2     2     1     4\n3     3     3     1     4\n\n# now lets create a track_xyt\ntr4 &lt;- make_track(df1, x, y, t, id = id, age = age)\ntr4\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n     x_    y_ t_            id   age\n* &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     1 2017-01-01     1     4\n2     2     2 2017-01-02     1     4\n3     3     3 2017-01-03     1     4\n\n\n\nmake_track has one further optional argument (crs), which allows the user to set a coordinate reference system (CRS) of the track.

Then we would consider the first 5 relocations as a burst and the second 10 relocations (after the 12 hour gap) as a second burst.\nFrom tracks to steps\nIn many situations we are more interested in steps (that is the animal moving from one relocation to an other, or the straight line between a start and a end point), than in the individual relocations. amt supports steps as an other way to represent movement data. The transition from a track to steps can be done via two functions.\n\n\nsteps(): Takes as an input a track, converts the track to step and calculating some derived quantities (e.g., step lengths, turning angles). The function steps() expects a track with regular sampling rates.\n\nsteps_by_burst(): Takes as an input a resampled track (i.e., a track with several bursts) and will calculate derived quantities per burst."

    "text": "How to deal with several animals\nUp to now we have only considered situations with one animal. However, in most telemetry studies more than one animal are tracked and we often want to calculated movement relevant characteristics for several animals individually. amt does not provide a infrastructure for dealing with several animal, however, list-columns from the tidyverse can be used to manage many animals. Because a track is just a tibble all tidyverse verbs can be used. The general strategy consists of three steps:\n\nNest a track by one or more columns. This retains the unique values of the grouping variable(s) and creates a new list-column with tracks.\nNow we can perform operations on the grouped data creating a new list column. This can be done in a combination with mutate and map (instead of map also lapply could be used).\nSelect the relevant columns and unnest. With select() we can select columns of interest and reverse the nesting with the function unnest().\n\nAs an example we will use a second data set included in amt on tracks of four fishers. We will load the data, create a track, resample the tracks individually to 30 min and create a histogram of step lengths (accounting for bursts).\nWe start by loading the data and creating a track of all individuals together\n\ndata(\"amt_fisher\")\ntrk &lt;- amt_fisher |&gt; make_track(x_, y_, t_, id = id,crs=4326)\n\nNext, we group the track by id and nest the track.\n\ntrk1 &lt;- trk |&gt; nest(data = -\"id\")\ntrk1\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  id    data                  \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt;                \n1 M1    &lt;trck_xyt [919 × 3]&gt;  \n2 M4    &lt;trck_xyt [8,958 × 3]&gt;\n3 F2    &lt;trck_xyt [3,004 × 3]&gt;\n4 F1    &lt;trck_xyt [1,349 × 3]&gt;\n\n\nWe now want to resample each track to 30 minutes with a tolerance of 5 minutes and create steps for each animal.

    "section": "Prepare Data for RSF",
    "text": "Prepare Data for RSF\nRandom Points\nBefore fitting a RSF we have to do some data preparation. We have to generate random points, points that we think the animal could have used. The random points define the availability domain. In amt the function random_points is designed to do just that. The function can be used in 3 different ways, depending to the type of object that is passed to the function call.\n\nA track_* (such as the deer object) can be passed to the function random_points. The function then calculates a home range (the home-range estimator can be controlled with argument hr). Within this home range n random points are generated. The default value of n is ten times the number of present points.\nIf a hr-object (i.e., the result of a home-range estimation in amt) is passed to random_points, points are generated within the home range. This allows to generate random points within any home range that was previously estimated in amt. Note, that this could be a home range of multiple animals. In this case, the function random_points has one additional argument called presence. This argument takes a trk_* with the presence points and adds these points for convenience to the random points.\nA SpatialPolygons*-object or sf-object. The latter must contain POLYGONs or MULTIPOLYGONs as features. This can be useful in situation where a home range needs to be buffered, or when other geographical features are considered as the availability domain. As before, this method for random_points also takes the argument presence to optionally add the observed points to the output.\n\nLets now illustrate the three different situations. First we take random points from a track_xy\n\nr1 &lt;- random_points(deer)\nplot(r1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the argument n we can control the number of random points (remember that the default is ten times as many points as we observed points).\n\nr1 &lt;- random_points(deer, n = 100)\nplot(r1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can also add the observed points:\n\nhr &lt;- hr_mcp(deer)\nr1 &lt;- random_points(hr, n = 500, presence = deer)\nplot(r1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can work with the home range and for example a buffer and then generate random points within the this new polygon.\n\nhr &lt;- hr_mcp(deer) |&gt; hr_isopleths() |&gt; \n  sf::st_buffer(dist =3e4) # add a 30km buffer\nr1 &lt;- random_points(hr, n = 500)\nplot(r1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can also add the observed points.\n\nhr &lt;- hr_mcp(deer) |&gt; hr_isopleths() |&gt; \n  sf::st_buffer(dist =3e4) # add a 30km buffer\nr1 &lt;- random_points(hr, n = 500, presence = deer)\nplot(r1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course we are not restricted to the sf::st_buffer function. All geometric operations from the sf package can be used to generate arbitrarily complex availability domains.\nExtract covariates\nAs the next step we have to extract the covariates at point. We can do this with extract_covariates.\n\nset.seed(5454)\nrsf1 &lt;- deer |&gt; random_points(n=20000, presence = deer) |&gt; \n  extract_covariates(forest.cover)  |&gt; \n  extract_covariates(shrub.cover) \ntable(rsf1$case_)\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n20000   826"

For a full understading, please see\nFieberg, J., Signer, J., Smith, B., & Avgar, T. (2021). A ’How to’guide for interpreting parameters in habitat‐selection analyses. Journal of Animal Ecology, 90(5), 1027-1043.\nWe are modeling the relative intensity of selection. Since we are defining the zeros here, it turns out that the intercept has no meaningful interpretation. The intercept is related to the ratio of used to available locations and that’s all. We can interpret the slope coefficients! Here, a coefficient at or really close to zero (no statistically clarity) indicate that the variable is being selected for in proportion to available.\nLooking at our results, we can see that the coefficient for percent forest is positive, thus as percent forest cover increases, the relative intensity of selection increases. In other words, in relative terms, more cover is selected for more than less cover. The opposite is true for the effects of shrub cover, which the coefficient is negative. Remember, this covariate is standardized. As shrub cover increases from the mean, we expect that deer will increasing select for these areas less than available. Also, as shrub cover decreases from the mean, we expect increasing selection to what is available by the deer.\nPlot Predicted Relative Selection\n\n# Decide on covariate values to predict to.

    "text": "Prepare Data for SSF\nSteps\nBefore fitting a SSF we have to do some data preparation. First, we change from a point representation to a step representation, using the function steps_by_burst, which in contrast to the steps function accounts for bursts.\n\nssf1 &lt;- deer |&gt; steps_by_burst()\n\nControl/random steps\nThe generic function random_steps provides a methods for a track_xy*, where each observed step is paired with n_control control steps (i.e., steps that share the same starting location but have different turn angles and step lengths). The distributions for drawing step lengths and turning angles are usually obtained by fitting known parametric distribution to the observed step length and turn angles.\nThe function random_steps has seven arguments. For most use cases the defaults are just fine, but there might situation where the user wants to adjust some of the arguments. The arguments are:\n\n\nx: This is the track_xy* for which the random steps are created. That is, for each step in x n_control random steps are created.\n\nn_control: The number of random steps that should be created for each observed step.\n\nsl_distr: This is the distribution of the step lengths. By default a gamma distribution is fit to the observed step lengths of the x. But any amt_distr is suitable here. 2\n\n\nta_distr: This is the turn angle distribution, with the default being a von Mises distribution.\n\nrand_sl: These are the random step lengths, by default 1e5 random numbers from the distribution fitted in 33.\n\nrand_ta: These are the random turn angles, by default 1e4 random numbers from the distribution fitted in 4.\n\ninclude_observed: This argument is by default TRUE and indicates if the observed steps should be included or not.\n\n2 See also ?fit_distr.3 Note, this possible because of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem and works as long as the sample from the original distribution (the sample you provide here) is large enough.The default situation\nIn most situations the following code snippet should work4.\n4 And how it was implemented in amt up to version 0.0.6. This should be backward compatible and not break existing code.\nssf1 &lt;- ssf1 |&gt; random_steps(n_control = 15)\n\nA exponential distribution for step lengths\ntodo\nExtract covariates\nAs a last step, we have to extract the covariates at the end point of each step. We can do this with extract_covariates.\n\nssf1 &lt;- ssf1 |&gt; extract_covariates(sh_forest) \n\nSince the forest layers is coded as 1 = forest and 2 != forest, we create a factor with appropriate levels. We also calculate the log of the step length and the cosine of the turn angle, which we may use later for a integrated step selection function.\n\nssf1 &lt;- ssf1 |&gt; \n  mutate(forest = factor(forest, levels = 1:0, labels = c(\"forest\", \"non-forest\")), \n         cos_ta = cos(ta_), \n        log_sl = log(sl_))"

    "text": "When we fit a habitat selection model (commonly called a resource selection function) we are often using convenient and general software/code to approximate the true underlying model. Specifically, we commonly use logistic regression to approximate the spatial point process model we are actually interested in fitting. To make sure our approximation of the point process model is done with minimal approximation error, we need to have a very large available sample (i.e., we need many zeros and their associated environmental covaraites) taken from the area/landscape/home range we are considering available to the individual(s).\n\nConduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate how large the available sample needs to be for the slope coefficient estimates to stabilize. Essentially, you want to increase the available sample size until the estimated coefficients no longer change. How you create your available sample (e.g., random sampling, systematic sampling) will determine when the estimated coefficients stop changing. The other factor is the error tolerance that you will accept. Lets use an error tolerance of 2 decimal places. Meaning, you want to increase the available sample until the first two decimal places of the estimated coefficients no longer change.\nYou will need to create several/many datasets with different sizes of the available sample (i.e, the number of zeros). Remember, the number of used locations (1’s) is the same for each dataset. Fit the same model (case_ ~ forest + cover) to each of these datasets. Extract the slope coefficients for the variables ‘forest’ and ‘shurb.cover’. Create a table of coefficient estimates along with the size of the available sample used (i.e., columns of 1) Size of available sample, 2) coef for forest, and 3) coef for shrub). Looking at the table, decide on whether the coefficient estimates have stabilized. Make sure to use a wide range of sizes of available samples. If you are unsure if they have converged, keep increasing the available sample size.\nSecondly, compare the converged coeficient estimates to a model fit using a 1:1 ratio of used locations to available locations. This is a common recommendation in the literature. If you had only fit the model with this size of available locations, how would your estimates compare to the estimates you get when using a very large available sample (converged estimates)? If there is any difference, this is due to approximation error. State how much error there is and whether it is a meaningful amount.\n\nHow you setup this sensitivity analysis will affect your ability to get estimates to converge. For example, if you take separate random samples, it might take a very large number (maybe more than a million) to get the estimates to converge. This is because there is no consistency between random draws of available sample. This stochasticity adds some additional variation when estimating. Another option would be to create a very large sample of available locations first and then create smaller subsets of these.\n\nUse the deer data provided in the amt package to fit a new habitat selection model that we have not considered yet. I would like you to fit a model where you hypothesize that selection for the proportion of forest changes depending on the time of day. Specifically, during daytime and nighttime. The idea being that risk changes to the deer depending on the time of day because of changes in predator and human activity. Please fit a model where there is an interaction between time of day (see code below how to get this covariate) and percent of forest cover. Please interpret your findings in terms of the estimated coefficients. If you want to go a bit further, make predictions of the relative intensity of selection for relevant covariate combinations. In terms of the available sample, use a very large available sample, but you do not need to conduct a sensitivity analysis.\nSince time of day is not a spatial variable, it is a bit different to include as a covariate.

    "text": "Abstract\nAnimal diel activity patterns can aid understanding of (a) how species behaviourally adapt to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, (b) mechanisms of species co-existence through temporal partitioning, and (c) community or ecosystem effects of diel activity shifts. Activity patterns often vary spatially, a feature ignored by the kernel density estimators (KDEs) currently used for estimating diel activity. Ignoring this source of heterogeneity may lead to biased estimates of uncertainty and misleading conclusions regarding the drivers of diel activity. Thus, there is a need for more flexible statistical approaches for estimating activity patterns and testing hypotheses regarding their biotic and abiotic drivers. We illustrate how trigonometric terms and cyclic cubic splines combined with hierarchical models can provide a valuable alternative to KDEs. Like KDEs, these models accommodate circular data, but they can also account for site-to-site and other sources of variability, correlation amongst repeated measures, and variable sampling effort. They can also more readily quantify and test hypotheses related to the effects of covariates on activity patterns. Through empirical case studies, we illustrate how hierarchical models can quantify changes in activity levels due to seasonality and in response to biotic and abiotic factors (e.g. anthropogenic stressors and co-occurrence). We also describe frequentist and Bayesian approaches for quantifying site-specific (conditional) and population-averaged (marginal) activity patterns. We provide guidelines and tutorials with detailed step-by-step instructions for fitting and interpreting hierarchical models applied to time-stamped data, such as those recorded by camera traps and audio recorders. We conclude that this approach offers a viable, flexible, and effective alternative to KDEs when modelling animal activity patterns."

    "text": "Abstract\nReducing the risk of declines to the threatened population of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the Atlantic coast USA, is a priority for U.S. state and federal agencies. One of plover biologists’ key management goals is to reduce nest predation rates. We evaluated a novel non-lethal technique to deter mammalian nest predators by deploying chemically extracted bird odors at scent stations on beaches where Piping Plovers nest. Our goal was to decrease mammalian predator’s interest in plover nests by providing unrewarded bird odor at scent stations placed across the landscape. We conducted fieldwork at Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and Ninigret NWR and Conservation Area in Rhode Island, USA. The primary mammalian nest predators were coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginianus). From late March through early June (2022–2023), we applied the bird odors extracted from waterfowl and gulls on the beaches at scent stations every three days. We monitored scent stations with trail cameras to record the frequency of predator visits and length of time predators spent at scent stations. Overall, there was high interspecific and annual variation in the number of detections and the length of time mammalian predators spent at scent stations. Total site-level coyote detections declined during the study period at both sites in 2022, but not in 2023; no other species showed potential habituation to scent stations. Odors extracted from waterfowl were more effective in attracting predators, in particular those derived directly from uropygial glands. Overall, we did not document a decline in Piping Plover nest predation rates when we deployed scent stations compared to the two previous years at both sites. This non-lethal technique was not effective at deterring mammalian nest predators at beaches in Rhode Island, USA."

However, we lack data and a standardized framework to accurately assess and compare temporal activity for species during rapid ecological change. Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity."

As perception depends on experience, we should expect habitat selection to be context dependent and individualistic.\nObjectives We hypothesized that: (i) fine-scale habitat selection of fisher (Pekania pennanti) in a human dominated landscape is driven by multiple interacting spatio-temporal factors; and (ii) an individual’s response to these factors depend on their exposure to anthropogenic disturbance within their home range (i.e., functional response).\nMethods We used fine-scale GPS location data of fisher in step-selection functions to make inference on the effects of human development, habitat loss, and road risk on fisher habitat selection.\nResults We found fisher habitat selection is individualistic, spatio-temporally dependent and a function of their exposure to anthropogenic disturbance in their home range. Fisher selected areas of lower road risk more frequently relative to availability, particularly during daylight hours. Higher road risk areas were only used more frequently when they were available at night. With a higher human land use in their home ranges fisher selected space near roads at night only, however when the extent of human use in their home range was lower, they selected areas further from roads at all times.\nConclusions Our study shows how individual variability allows fisher to adapt their diel activity to utilize resources in areas of high human land use. This further emphasizes the importance of accounting for individuality and multiple interacting spatio-temporal factors in habitat selection, particularly in highly human modified landscapes."

    "text": "Abstract\nMonitoring wildlife populations through the collection of abundance and distribution data across climatic seasons and multiple years is critical to understanding wildlife spatiotemporal dynamics. This is especially important in landscapes faced with natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which include the state of Rhode Island, USA. Rhode Island is the second most densely populated state in the United States, yet the landscape remains highly forested. Similar to many areas in the region, land cover change and conversion to non-habitat cover types continue to be an issue as a result of increased anthropogenic disturbance, in addition to recent natural disturbance including forest structural changes from the spongy moth caterpillar (Lymantria dispar). These changes in land cover types and landscape patterns have the potential to positively or negatively affect wildlife communities, and thus, it is increasingly important to monitor wildlife populations. Camera traps provide an efficient way to inventory and monitor a large spatial area and record detections of a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates. We began surveying the state of Rhode Island as part of a focal study on bobcats (Lynx rufus, 2018–2020) and later fishers (Pekania pennanti, 2020–2023) while documenting all species of terrestrial vertebrates detected at camera survey locations. We placed cameras in areas with land cover appropriate for the original target species—primarily forests and forested wetlands—and avoided placing cameras directly along hiking trails or roads. The state was divided into two sections—west and east—to maximize study area coverage with limited equipment. Cameras were deployed for at least six weeks in each survey period and section. In total, we monitored 249 survey sites in the state over 12 survey periods (six winter seasons, five summer seasons, and one spring season). We collected 244,013 unique detections from 39 terrestrial vertebrate species (25 mammal species, 13 bird species, and non-personnel humans) throughout the study. These data provide spatial and temporal detection information that is useful for investigating the changes in wildlife populations over time and varying degrees of development through analyses including single species, multi-species, dynamic, and diel occupancy modeling. Results of these analyses can be used to understand how a changing landscape impacts wildlife species. The data are openly available for reuse, and please cite this data paper when these data are used in other materials."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Context: For the spatial occupancy model used to predict wolverine occurrence, there are two input files for each survey: One summarizes the visit data (i.e., detection history) for all of the cells we actually surveyed. The second summarizes attributes of all cells in the sampling frame that we are trying to project/predict to with the fitted model. Over the course of the 2 surveys (2017, 2022), we have accumulated 4 input files. In comparing these files, we found the following anomalies that had to be rectified:\nCHANGES\n\nAt least 3 different datums were used among the files, therefore coordinate fields did not match between some spatial layers. This is critical because the spatial occupancy model relies on coordinates during the model-fitting process. This has been rectified and all input files use the same coordinates/coordinate system. One of the coordinate systems was USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic USGS. Our GIS shop suggested this was most appropriate for the west-wide grid, so that’s the one we chose to match to and that’s what all “official” layers we’ve built are projected in.\nWe used at least 3 different ID fields to identify cells across the 4 input files. These have all been matched up via spatial joins and rectified. We propose using GRID_ID field from the layer that depicts all 18,000+ cells that cover the entire western U.S. This is probably not the ID most have used in the past; from what I’ve seen most states are using an ID that enumerates only the cells in the wolverine sampling frame. The GRID_ID field” is the only identifier that will work seamlessly moving forward if we need to add states, add provinces, drop cells, add replacement cells, etc. More on this and a repository for spatial data layers later.\nThe ‘habitat’ covariate used in the 2017 non-spatial analysis was actually the Copeland et al. 2010 snow model, not the union of that and the Inman et al. 2013 habitat model. We are pretty sure we meant to use the Copeland+Inman habitat layer as the covariate as that was the one used to define the sampling frame in the first place. This didn’t noticeably change the estimates of wolverine occupancy or the estimated coefficient of the habitat covariate by much compared to what we published in the 2020 JWM paper, but it has been updated so it matches the 2022 analysis.\nOur 2020 manuscript (survey 2017) says we drew a GRTS sample of n = 185 and missed two cells we actually sampled, thus n = 183. In reality, we added some cells beyond the GRTS draw, and missed more than two for a grand total of n = 188 actually visited. We can’t go back and re-write that paper, but those sentences are incorrect. We’ll state them correctly this time around.\nIn the most recent version of our draft manuscript (survey 2022) we were using a version of the 2017 sampling frame that only had 601 cells rather than 633 cells, so the part of the analysis comparing occupancy between years was a bit of an apples and oranges comparison. The discrepancy was an old layer floating around that represented the sampling frame prior to the room of experts adding 32 cells to it at the Salmon meeting. This has been rectified and Katie re-ran the covariates to include those previously missing 32 cells.\nTable 2 in the most recent version of the draft manuscript (survey 2022) states there were n = 151 cells in CO for the 2022 survey. This is the number for the entire state, but we chose to only survey north of I-70, so the actual number of total cells we picked a sample from was n = 45.\nTable 2 in the most recent version of the draft manuscript (survey 2022) indicates WA sampled 26 cells but one camera failed, so 25 cells total. The map in figure 1 shows that 14 cells were missed. Due to time constraints these 14 cells weren’t coded within CPW PhotoWarehouse, but the cells were sampled, photos reviewed, and no detections occurred. The visit input file for 2022 has been updated to reflect 14 additional cells with zero detections. We also removed an additional cell that was added by accident.\nFor each year, the “state” assigned to each cell in the input file was based on which state submitted the data. However, for border cells, states help each other out and sometimes cover cells that are technically in the adjoining state. This resulted in another apples and oranges comparison as the states associated with each cell changed somewhat between surveys, so our occupancy estimates for a given state weren’t based on summing the same cells for each survey. This has been rectified so that the state assigned to a cell is based on the centroid of the cell. If you prefer some other metric (e.g., majority area in a given state, which might change ownership of a couple of cells), we can do that. We just need to decide and lock that in."

    "text": "Abstract\nTranslocations are an established element of restoration plans for threatened species, but success in establishing new populations is often limited, highlighting the need for careful evaluation of translocation efforts. Variation among individuals may contribute to poorly placed translocations, particularly when there is variation in the spatial ecology of target species. As a test of this we investigated the spatial ecology of imperiled New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis Bangs, 1895) in Rhode Island, USA. We combined telemetry data with remotely-sensed vegetation data to evaluate the home ranges, resource selection, and survival of translocated cottontails at three sites, including one where we also tracked resident cottontails. Despite instances of alignment among individuals, we found a wide span of home range estimates and high individual variability on resource selection. Both of these results suggest that population-level inferences of translocated individuals may fail to capture important aspects of animal ecology at the individual level. Further, we found lower survival compared to residents at one of our sites and literature values for other resident populations. Our results suggest that there are benefits to considering variation among individuals when designing management plans to support translocations."

Please feel free to make comments directly on the google doc. I am looking for areas of confusion, areas of flow or introduction of concepts that may be out of order, and areas that we can cut/de-emphasize, and areas that need expanding. This manuscript is not so much a review, but a modern synthesis to give some important context/opinion and then point the reader to modern papers.\n\n\n\n\nDownloads: Files\nInstall R packages:\n\n\n# CRAN packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"terra\",\"raster\",\"amt\",\"MASS\",\"sp\"))\n\n\n\nWright et al 2020"

    "text": "Course Description\nThis course covers the core concepts of sampling design, including survey sampling theory and techniques, which provide a foundation for designing and interpreting fish and wildlife studies.\nSampling designs and surveys are generally covered sparsely in statistics courses regularly taken in graduate school, yet, such designs are key to solving fish and wildlife enumeration problems in the field. A commanding understanding of the different sampling designs available to fish and wildlife managers, as well as practice with the statistical tools that allow for the detection, enumeration, or even the occupancy of fish and wildlife populations, are essential to making sound management and conservation recommendations. This course will introduce students to sampling theory and will provide practical examples that apply to fish and wildlife studies."
