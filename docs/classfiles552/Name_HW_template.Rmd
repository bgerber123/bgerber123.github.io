This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. For assignments, I will ask you for the Rmd file and the knitted HTML, along with any other files that are external to the Rmd file and loaded; this allows me to execute your code if need be.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r sample1}
# Create an object called 'values' that consists of the integers from 1 to 1000
  values =  seq(1,1000)

# Set the seed for a random number generator and sample (size of 10) from the object 'values'
  set.seed(432432)
  s1 = sample(values, size = 10, replace = FALSE)
  s1
```


```{r sample2}
# Create an object called 'normal.values' that come from a Normal Distribution
# with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 10 (sample size of 50)
  set.seed(4324321)
  normal.values =  rnorm(50, mean = 100, sd = 10)

  normal.values
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}
  par(mfrow=c(2,1))
  hist(normal.values)
  
  plot(density(normal.values),
       lwd = 3
       )
  
  curve(dnorm(x, 100,10),
        add = TRUE,
        col = 2,
        lwd = 4
        )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` argument was added to the code chunk so that the code text is not printed in the output file.
