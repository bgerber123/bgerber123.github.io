### Estimating White-tailed Deer Abundance

**Objectives** 1) To develop a stochastic population reconstruction model to estimate deer abundance using harvest data, and 2) consider design implications of a forward-looking infraed aerial survey of deer.

**Team**: Edwige Bellier (Postdoctoral Researcher), Amy Mayer (Research Associate), Brian Gerber (PI), David Kalb, and Dylan Ferreira and the RI Department of Environmental Management, Fish and Wildlife Division.
