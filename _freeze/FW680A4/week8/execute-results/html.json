Was this effort adequate?\n\n- What other aspects of ecological processes are not addressed by the objectives? Could these have been incorporated in this study?\n\n- Were their any findings you found particularly important? Anything that stood out to you, good or bad, in the methodology or interpretation?\n\n- Is the study area and scale of analysis relevant to each of the 4 salamanders?\n\n- Are the prediction maps useful or relevant for salamander conservation?\n\n<br>\n \n##### **In Class Discussion of Guillera-Arroita et al. 2015**\n\n- What is a SDM?\n\n- What are they used for?\n\n- What are the types of data used and how does that change the inference/predictions?\n\n- What are the three joint probabilities that determine whether a site is recorded as a detection in a dataset?\n\n- What is the difference/importance of being able to estimate occurrence probability and occurence relative likelihood?\n\n- What are some specific model types or algorithms commonly used for fitting a SDM?\n\n<!-- -   Lecture (Code): <a href=\"/classfiles/hbayes/Bayesian.Hierarchical.Model.zip\">Bayesian Hierarchical Model Files</a> -->\n\n<!-- -   Install R packages: -->\n\n<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE} -->\n<!-- # CRAN packages -->\n<!-- install.packages(c(\"brms\",\"bayesplot\")) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n#### [Assigned]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n -   Readings for next class:\n     - <a href=\"/readings/Wildman et al 2024.pdf\">Wildman et al 2024</a>\n     - <a href=\"/readings/Kery and Schaub Ch7.pdf\">Kery and Schaub Ch 7 (sections 7.1-7.3)</a>\n\n \n### Day 2 (lab)\n\n#### [Today]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\n##### **In Class Discussion of Wildman et al 2024, led by Alex Badeaux, Noel Clark, Elke Tukker**\n\n-   Groups work on defining the CJS model using constant parameters and then with sex effect on survival, but not detection.
