# Who and What

I am a research scientist with the United States Geological Survey [(USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/), Assistant Unit Leader at the [Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Colorado), an Associate Professor in the [Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology](https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/) and a faculty member of the [Graduate Degree Program in Ecology](https://ecology.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/).

My focus is on *collaborative science*:

With my lab and colleagues - we work with scientists and resource and land managers to help learn through data to provide inferential or predictive knowledge or decision-support that is used for empirically informed conservation management of biodiversity.

#### *Our research focus includes*

-   Wildlife Population Demography and Distribution
-   Conservation Decision Making
-   Animal Behavior (especially on the diel niche)
-   Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling
-   Animal Movement and Habitat Selection
-   Optimal Prediction via Statistical Regularization

[Download](/publications/Gerber et al 2024 JAE.pdf). We propose a conceptual and modeling framework to connect data and hypotheses to make inference about animal diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal). The Diel.Niche R package can be found on [Github](https://github.com/diel-project/Diel-Niche-Modeling) and a shiny version can be found [here](https://shiny.celsrs.uri.edu/bgerber/DielNiche/). We also wrote a [blog](https://animalecologyinfocus.com/2024/01/18/defining-and-making-inference-on-the-diel-niche/) about our paper that is intended for a more general audience.
