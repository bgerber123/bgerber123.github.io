# Who 

I am a research scientist with the United States Geological Survey [(USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/), Assistant Unit Leader at the [Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit](https://www1.usgs.gov/coopunits/unit/Colorado), an Associate Professor in the [Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology](https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/) and a faculty member of the [Graduate Degree Program in Ecology](https://ecology.colostate.edu/) at [Colorado State University](https://www.colostate.edu/).

# What are cooperative research units?

The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cooperative Research Units (CRU) is to 

- conduct research to inform the management of fish and wildlife
- train graduate students to be effective natural resource scientists, biologists, and managers
- provide technical assistance to natural resource and conservation agencies and groups

The CRU Program was established in 1935 and codified by Congress (Public Law 86-686) in 1960.

The Colorado Unit is staffed, supported, and coordinated by Colorado State University, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the Wildlife Management Institute.

# What I do?

**My focus is on collaborative science**:

With my lab and colleagues, we work with scientists and resource and land managers to help learn through data to provide inferential or predictive knowledge or decision-support that is used for empirically informed conservation management of animal species and their habitats.

**My focus is on statistical ecology**:

My research often includes developing, evaluating, and applying modern sampling techniques and statistical modeling. I am perhaps a generalist in this regard, as I do not focus on a single class of statistics or statistical models. 

**Teaching**

I teach two graduate courses at Colorado State University, [FW670: Wildlife Ecology Modeling](https://bgerber123.github.io/FW680A4/) and [FW552: Applied Sampling for Fish and Wildlife Studies](https://bgerber123.github.io/FW552/). These courses emphasize the theory and practice of sampling, estimation, and statistical modeling relevant to fish and wildlife ecology and management. 

I also teach workshops that have focused mainly on coding in the R programming language, general statistical modeling (hierarhical Bayesian modeling), and more specific topics (mark-recapture, integrated population models).

#### *Some Research Topics*

-   **Wildlife Population Demography and Distribution**
    - mark-recapture, species distribution modeling, population reconstruction / harvest modeling, integrated population modeling, 
-   **Study design / Model Evaluation**
    - simulation and model robustness analysis, power analysis
-   **Conservation Decision Making**
    - structured decision making, adaptive management
-   **Animal Behavior**
    - diel niche, species interactions, predator-prey 
-   **Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling**
    - integrated data modeling, observational/process modeling
-   **Animal Movement and Habitat Selection**
    - home range, movement modeling, habitat selection
-   **Optimal Prediction via Statistical Regularization**
    - lasso, ridge, elastic net, machine learning algorithms
